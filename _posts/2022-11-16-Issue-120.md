## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Mastodon</b></div>

Well, after two and a half years, COVID finally came to my house. So this will be short and sweet, because I really want to go and take another nap.

So, is this a thing? I generally make note of interesting stuff I read, primarily on Twitter, and save links to my newsletter Trello board. When I go to put together a given week’s newsletter, I sort all the stuff I’ve found into categories, and then pick things out for inclusion in the newsletter.

This week, every Twitter post I saved is coming up &lsquo;protected&rsquo;. Are a lot of people doing this? Switching profiles to protected/private?

Anyway, if you find yourself joining the great Twitter migration to <a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a>, I suspect most of you would find the [Ruby.social](https://ruby.social) instance to be quite interesting. I joined quite some time ago ([@wndxlori@ruby.social](https://ruby.social/@wndxlori)) and recently so did Amir Rajan ([@amirrajan@ruby.social](https://ruby.social/@amirrajan)) and Matz Matsumoto ([@matz@ruby.social](https://ruby.social/@matz)).

Stampede over and join the party!

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

Here are our selections from the two most widely used RubyMotion/DRGTK chat spaces,  respectively:

* <b>Slack</b> &mdash; [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are the &lsquo;official&rsquo; way of automating software workflows with the promise of being able to &ldquo;build, test and deploy your code from GitHub&rdquo;. [A discussion](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1666204569988969?thread_ts=1665586323.793689&cid=C055RDLS0) on that subject fired up recently, with the intent of making all that goodness happen with RubyMotion.

* <b>Discord</b> &mdash; The prolific Kevin Fischer-Okarin is back at it, this time not with a new game or game jam but [a game state inspector](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/1019595235044634684) called [Palantir](https://kfischer-okarin.itch.io/palantir). Can we also just say that we're in awe of Kevin's productivity?!

## TWIL &#8212; This Week I Learned...

Have you ever had the situation where Apple Maps simply <em>refuses</em> to forget that one time you visited <em>Chuck E. Cheese</em> and keeps routing you back there? After all, junior is in college now. Well, now you can take control of your destination destiny by [removing significant locations](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph32b15b22f/ios) on your iPhone.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

Classic chicken &#128020; or the egg &#129370; problem, right? There's [a handy device](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/ksjhvv/app_license_key/) for that.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On...

On the long <em>long</em> list of things we didn't know was anything about the [Jackson Project](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) or, as you may know it, &ldquo;the Java JSON library&rdquo;. What we also didn't know was that it's now available to RubyMotion through a project by Darin Wilson called [moran](https://github.com/darinwilson/moran) (as in "mow ran").

And on a completely different, unrelated subject&mdash;about which we were also clueless&mdash;is Olly Mills' (AKA The Dark Magi) DragonRuby room generation tool. Or, as he likes to call it, a [starting point](https://github.com/thedarkmagi/Dragon_Ruby_Room_Generation_Starting_Point/tree/main) for same. Seems kinda handy.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

Amir has announced the &ldquo;[last major release of this year](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk/devlog/450794/dragonruby-steam-deck)&rdquo; for the DragonRuby Game Toolkit. Wisely, he says &ldquo;large changes during the holiday season are usually a bad idea&rdquo;. While we can't believe it's already <em>that</em> time of the year, it's hard to argue with the logic that finessing a tricky release while punchdrunk on eggnog is ill-advised, at best. This final-release-of-2022 comes with [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) remote hotloads which means you'll probably want to get that done before you, too, become punchdrunk on eggnog.
