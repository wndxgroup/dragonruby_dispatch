## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: large; text-align: left; padding-top: 20px;"><b>FFS</b></div>

And here we go again. In case you haven't been following the saga of my eye problems, let me quickly bring you up to date:

<table style="font-size: smaller;">
	<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
		<td style="width: 150px;">August 2020</td>
		<td>Macular hole in left eye&mdash;result: can't use my computer, because whatever part of the screen I'm looking at &lsquo;disappears&rsquo;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
		<td>Late September 2020</td>
		<td>Eye surgery to repair macular hole</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
		<td>December 2020</td>
		<td>Finally back at work</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
		<td>February 2021</td>
		<td>Left eye develops cataract&mdash;90% likelihood after macular hole surgery</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
		<td>May 2021</td>
		<td>Cataract surgery on left eye</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
		<td>July 2021</td>
		<td>Aniseikonia magnification difference between eyes&mdash;still can't work</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
		<td>September 2021</td>
		<td>Right eye contact to counteract aniseikonia&mdash;I can work again!</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
		<td>November 2021</td>
		<td style="padding-bottom: 10px">Macular hole in right eye</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Anyway, this time I get to have both corrective procedures (macular hole and cataract lens replacement) in one surgery. By the time you receive this, I'll actually be one day post-surgery. But it'll be another month to six weeks before I can read or use a computer (again), so the newsletter will be on hiatus until I get back.

Be good! And by that I actually mean read and follow these guidelines: [Understanding Success Criterion 6.1.1: Give a Shit](https://useragentman.com/wcag-wishlist/)

## FITS &#8212; Featured in the School

When you look at things <em>very</em> closely&mdash;they can be so beautiful...even the humble moth (at 6000 frames-per-second, that is). I've been doing a lot of this lately, working around my eye issues. But on the bright side, I finally finished the content for the complete <em>[6 Pack Apps for Entrepreneurs](https://6packapps.io)</em> course. I'm pretty proud of the result, but it will remain behind the veil until I am back in the saddle, when my waitlist people will get first crack at it. If you know anyone who could benefit from this course, please share the link!

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

As usual, we have a bit from both of the DragonRuby chat spaces:

<ul>

<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><b>Slack</b> &mdash; Ever heard of the [Mandela Effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-mandela-effect-4589394)? We hadn't either. But it might have been in play recently on the [Motioneers Slack](https://motioneers.slack.com), when she was recently asked for a link to her video on adapting Swift-to-RubyMotion. But there was no such video, despite the collective memory to contrary &mdash;that's the aformentioned Mandela Effect. There was, however, a written tutorial on the subject: [IgListKit Tutorial RubyMotion Edition Part 1](https://www.wndx.com/blog/iglistkit-tutorial-rubymotion-edition/).</li>

<li style="padding-bottom: 10px;"><b>Discord</b> &mdash; From <em>Chris | Xed</em> recently: &ldquo;<em>If you haven't tried playing around with DragonRuby's hotload feature, here's a wonderful way to get all of [your magic numbers working correctly!](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/852024721217945600)</em> &#129315;&rdquo;</li>

<li><b>Late Breaking News</b> &mdash; [RubyMotion 8.2 has been released](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1647418676572439)! And it has added support for Xcode 13.3.</li>

</ul>

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

What with the utterly ghastly news that is seemingly everywhere at the moment, this was almost inevitable: [Tractor Game](https://twitter.com/AkinUnver/status/1503846520403148812?s=20&t=CAO66nEoEi8NtBtVeQFWBQ)

## APP &#8212; All Things App

Many of us will just have gone through the annual rite of &lsquo;springing forward&rsquo; Even if you're one of those jurisdictions that <em>doesn't</em> change the clocks twice a year, you're still impacted by it as you try and mentally work out how many timezones it is to wherever your Zoom meeting colleagues are located and whether they changed the clock or not.

Every year when this happens, don't we all vow to deal with it &lsquo;once and for all?&rsquo;  Inevitably in that follow on conversation, all roads seem to lead not to Rome, but to UTC. But even if we go that route, [it is not without its pitfalls](https://twitter.com/AmNicd/status/1503080914657685506).

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On...

So, have you wanted to get your feet wet with DragonRuby game development but like a lot of us, need some sort of concrete incentive to get us off and running?  How about a [game jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam)? Even better, how about one that lets you work out some of your passive agressive antipathy toward your boss? Yep, it's [Boss Battle: A DragonRuby Game Jam](https://twitter.com/Groteskly/status/1500503292417351682): &ldquo;<em>Think of games like Legend of Zelda, Titan Souls and Binding of Issac. One player, one big bad enemy, limitless possibilities.</em>&rdquo;

## TWIL &#8212; This Week I Learned...

<a href="https://twitter.com/divinetechygirl/status/1489424532486205445?s=12"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/ibook-conversion-300x300.png" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right:10px; padding-bottom: 5px; width: 125px"></a>

There's a trend that while we're good with it, we also admit we do not understand. We'll simply call <em>retro-style</em>: making modern things look like they are old. The new [Mini](https://www.miniusa.com) falls into this category. So do [cruiser bikes](https://www.ruff-cycles.com/ruff-cycles-ebikes/the-ruffian-bosch-ebike-pedelec.html) and [mom jeans](https://www.ae.com/ca/en/c/women/jeans/mom-jeans/cat8230077).

But we think that this trend has hit a new apex with [this project](https://twitter.com/divinetechygirl/status/1489424532486205445?s=12). Lori, in particular, has fallen in love with it. The only open question is whether she has time to make one for herself using her new [SnapMaker](https://snapmaker.com). Of course you do, Lori. You just have to use those otherwise wasted hours between midnight and 6.00 am.
