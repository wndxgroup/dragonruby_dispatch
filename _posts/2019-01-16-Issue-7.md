Last week I was in NYC.  This week, I'm sick ðŸ¤’.  Blargh. But the newsletter must go on...

### Featured in the School

Ok, I know there's 150 of you on this mailing list already (yay).  But a grand total of only 
4 people filled out my form ðŸ¥º. It's really just a [tiny, short form](https://loriolson.typeform.com/to/RKK0mc?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7), 
only [3 questions](https://loriolson.typeform.com/to/RKK0mc?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7). It'll 
take you less than 30 secs to fill out, but it would really help me out with content planning 
for the year.  

### Slack Highlights

In a discussion about [live reload via pm_live](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1546630264069400?thread_ts=1546566768.065000&cid=C055RDLS0&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7), 
started by Corey Condardo, we were reminded that 
pm_live no longer works.  But don't despair, because you can use this [nifty auto build](https://github.com/amirrajan/rubymotion-autobuild/blob/master/auto-build.rb?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7) script 
that Amir posted, to eval anything you type in the REPL. 

And if you haven't signed up for Slack yet, you can get access by going to [motioneers.herokuapp.com](http://motioneers.herokuapp.com/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7).

### Gem of the Week

Over on [rubymotion-applied](https://github.com/amirrajan/rubymotion-applied?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7), 
thanks to Amir, we have a nice set of [examples of using Bacon](https://github.com/amirrajan/rubymotion-applied/issues/117?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7) to 
test your RubyMotion code.  Testing can sometimes be hard, so more examples are good to have 
around! 

I'm featuring RubyMotion gems here each week.  Sometimes because they are awesome, and sometimes 
because they need some love. Remember, if you have a gem you'd like featured, just reply to this 
email, or you can PM me in Slack! 

### Community Forum

This week in "community", since the forum is still a bit quiet, I thought I'd mention Amir's 
hunt for a new logo for [Dragon Ruby](http://dragonruby.org/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7). Dragon Ruby is the open source initiative for RubyMotion. 
Since RubyMotion is built on the LLVM, and the LLVM logo is a dragon... So go check out the 
[logo contest](https://99designs.ca/brand-identity-pack/contests/logo-suite-tools-used-game-app-developers-883944/poll/8073c5ba46/vote?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7), and sign in there to vote for your favourites. (Psst. Number 94 is MY favourite.
Vote for it!!!)

And here's your reminder to introduce yourself on the [Hello World](http://community.rubymotion.com/t/hello-world-start-here/13?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7) post on the community forum!

### App Highlight of the Week

I suppose it might be possible that people on this list could be unaware of Amir's award winning 
text adventure game, [A Dark Room](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/a-dark-room/id736683061?mt=8&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7).
But did you know that he's also been working on a [manuscript](https://github.com/amirrajan/survivingtheappstore/blob/master/manuscript/dev-logs-part-3.md?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7) 
about his adventures in dealing with the rollercoaster ride to #1?  It makes for some 
fascinating behind-the-scenes reading.

Psst!!! If you have an app (even if it's not in the App Store) send me the details, and I'll add 
it to the list to be featured!

### TWIL (This Week I Learned) Links 

Here's a Swift project for the [Coordinator pattern](https://github.com/radianttap/Coordinator?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=7).  I think it would make a *great* RubyMotion 
gem, if anyone was looking for a small project to work on.

And our bonus extra link... [Donald Knuth's next book](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0134671791/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=twg0f-20&linkId=be6e6b7ee706cef7d15cf42621ec0ff3&language=en_CA) is finally coming out. The original first 
volume was published over 50 years ago (and with a few updates, still totally relevant today), 
and he's still working on more algorithms in more books.

That's it for this week! Cough, cough, ACHOO!
