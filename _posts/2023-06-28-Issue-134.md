## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>If Feels Good to Have Made Something</b></div>

<a href="https://wandering.shop/@sarahijackson/110601308851114103"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/mr-rogers-400x331.png" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; width: 50%;"></a>

While some of you may not be familiar with Mr. Rogers, he was an icon of children's TV for decades in North America. This week I was reminded ‚¨ÖÔ∏è that I should always be creating. Even if I'm not very good at what I am trying to do. No matter what other people have to say about my work. Because it feels good to have made something.

## FITS &#8212; Featured in the School

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Upcoming Free Webinar: App Prototyping</b></div>

One of the problems some software developers seem to have when they start experimenting with creating mobile apps is a tendency to leap into coding, without thinking about little things like design and usability. I think it might be that whole "let's start with <em>Hello World</em>" mentality. My upcoming webinar, <em>App Prototyping</em>, will show you how to <b>start</b> by quickly creating a simple prototype to explore <b>how</b> your app will work, <b>before</b> you waste a bunch of time coding up screens and flows.

This is probably the <b>last</b> time this webinar will be offered for free&mdash;so [register today](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUoc-GgrTIsGNGibaLx3x5ajehrndYgQm7z?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) and I hope to see you there!

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

Here are this issue's selections from the two main RubyMotion/DRGTK chat spaces:

* </a><b>Slack</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Further to [a recent post](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RS2D8/p1686699070440589?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) from &lsquo;Yasu&rsquo;, if you are planning on submitting your latest magnum opus to the Apple App Store&mdash;and were planning on using <small><code>[altool](https://keith.github.io/xcode-man-pages/altool.1.html?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</code></small> for the mandatory [app notorization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)&mdash;you had better think again. Apple has announced that  notarization in the future will be done with <small><code>[notarytool](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3147-migrating-to-the-latest-notarization-tool?changes=_3_3?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</code></small>. So far as support for the latter with RubyMotion, we've heard Amir is working on it! 

* <b>Discord</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;There's nothing like tapping into two trends for the price of one: our friend Akzidenz is [working on a library](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/1122159293400109066?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) which imports files written in Markdown (that's the first hot trend) into interactive text adventure games (the second hot trend).

Participating in either and/or both of these two forums is a real benefit and is <b>absolutely free</b>.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

For those who have either finished or are just about to wrap up your game masterpiece&mdash;and assuming you are neither independently wealthy and/or already hooked up with a publisher&mdash;you're about to learn just about <b>any</b> kind of exposure is <b>good</b> exposure. Further to that, from [a recent toot](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@byway/110567178944295908?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) üí® we just learned about [Byway](https://cohost.org/byway/post/1708939-about-byway-and-how?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com): a &ldquo;newsletter about games made by independent creators&rdquo;.<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/vision-pro-400x400.png" style="float: right; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 20px; width: 50%;"></a>To be featured in a &lsquo;micro-review&rsquo; [submit your game](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGe3G0qLJu7mXiOEi_WABSMwlJglP9FBEEqMmnJLd2ZOPTGw/viewform?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) today.

What with all the frothy excitement in response to Apple's announcement of the groundbreaking <em>Vision Pro</em> ‚û°Ô∏è it's understandable that those of us in the dev community would want to get the earliest possible peak at <em>visionOS</em>. A [toot üí® from Jen Simmons](https://front-end.social/@jensimmons/110584407977792372?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) alerted us to the availability of its SDK&mdash;best jump on that bandwagon lest you be run over by a &lsquo;real reality&rsquo; stampede.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

If you don't happen to have US$3,499&mdash;what the <em>Vision Pro</em> will set you back&mdash;just sitting around gathering dust, you're going to want to have the latest and greatest of device simulators at your disposable. Presumably that will eventually include something for the aforemention <em>Vision Pro</em>. Now, if you're having trouble downloading these simulators, [Dave Murdock's toot](https://mastodon.online/@davemurdock/110588825629346804?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) üí® pointed us in the direction of the official Apple tutorial that will undoubtedly help out.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On ...

Have you ever caught yourself wondering how your own approach to game development compares to others? We have. So here's a real oppportunity to &lsquo;peak over the shoulder&rsquo; of veteran game dev Justin Collins as his game concept comes together. It's captured in a thread (or should it be a tootery, perhaps?) of [illustrated toots üí® on just that subject](https://ruby.social/@presidentbeef/110068786502093179?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com).
