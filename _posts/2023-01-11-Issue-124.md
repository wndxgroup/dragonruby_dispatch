As such, they have taken off for a well-deserved, three week celebration of their 20th anniversary. Check out [Lori&rsquo;s Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wndxlori?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) for highlights!

What with the holiday and all, and with your forbearance, we'll skip the January 25th edition and return to our regular biweekly newsletter schedule on February 8th!

## BREAKING NEWS

Just before we get to the &lsquo;best of&rsquo; stuff, there is one piece of current breaking news: [DragonRuby Game Toolkit V4.0](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/815289039338340414/1056483040416772119?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) has been released! That's a pretty great start to 2023!

## THE BEST OF 2022

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-top: 20px;"><b>Impostor Club</b></div>
<div style="font-size: small; text-align: left; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 5px;"><em>DRD108: June 1, 2022</em></div>

A recent tweet by [David Bock](https://twitter.com/bokmann/status/1490847072802975744?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) tipped me off to a great essay by Chad Fowler entitled <em>[Welcome to Impostor Club](https://medium.com/@chadfowler/welcome-to-impostor-club-a800b95017c6?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. (Think <em>Fight Club</em> as in &ldquo;The first rule of <em>Fight Club</em> is&mldr;&rdquo; It's in that vein, I think.)

In any event, a lot of people experience this feeling. The feeling that what they know, what they have learned, is just scratching the surface of some deeper learning, that only <b>real</b> experts have.

I remember a fun discussion I had, when I was a member of <em>TeamB</em> (unofficial dev rel group for Borland IDE products, when Borland still existed). At the annual <em>TeamB</em> conference, we had finished all our group meetings for the day, and were sitting around having a couple of drinks with the Borland developers. I thought, at this time, that these people were operating at a development level <b>far</b> above where I was, even though I was one of the people out there in their discussion groups, answering questions about how to use their products. 

Then the conversation came around to a bug that I and one of the other <em>TeamB</em> devs had experienced in JBuilder, the Java IDE. We were able to describe it precisely, and repeatably. The lead developer, who's name escapes me now, was a German expat (trust me that's relevant) and he looked at us in confusion and said, &ldquo;That's really weird&rdquo; (say that in your head, in a German accent, it's <b>way</b> more funny). Anyway, we all burst out laughing, and I suddenly realized that these people were &lsquo;just developers&rsquo; like me, and for that moment in time, my imposter syndrome was busted.

Here's a thought for you to practice, when you have that imposter feeling. What you know is <b>always</b> more than what some other subset of people know. <em>Your Knowledge, Your Experience, Your Aptitude</em>. And the people that know more than you? At one time, they had to learn it all too.

That's because it was prohibitively expensive to do anything other than that. Animation was a completely analogue process consisting of [painted cels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) each of which was lovingly created by a real human being. Turns out that while we're not likely to return to painted cels any time soon (sadly?) the idea of statically projecting portions of an animated scene for efficiency's sake is an old idea that's new again.

What with Lori's recent bout of COVID and her attendance at RubyConf, it's forgivable that the yellow sticky note with <em>RubyMotion 8.8 released!</em> scratched on it somehow got 'misplaced'.
