Hey, look at that... I managed to do this 2 weeks in a row ;-)  

### Featured in the School

The second edition of Core Data in Motion book is resurfacing in the [WNDX School](https://wndx.school?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2) as a course.
It's totally not ready yet (and won't be for a while), but I get a lot of people asking about 
the book.  So, just for you dear subscribers, here's the link - [Core Data In Motion](https://wndx.school/p/core-data-in-motion/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2). You can buy 
this course for the price of the book.  Get the 1st edition book now, and you'll have complete 
access to the course content when it appears.  Once I start adding that content, the price will 
be doubling, just so ya know...

### Slack Highlights

This week in Slack, Amir pointed out in the [#Android channel](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C056DLZ1V/p1544528365005800?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2) that RubyMotion Starter edition 
ships with one, and only one, version of Android SDK enabled.  Right now that is v27.  In 
user-land, we call that Android Oreo 8.1. Important to know, if you aren't on Indie or 
Professional yet.

Also in Slack... we have cancelled the December [RubyMotion Meetup](http://meetup.rubymotion.com/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2) (these are held online).
Current schedule seems to be causing some participation difficulties.  Come on in to the [#meetup 
channel](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C1DFJ9ES1/p1544586762003400?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2) and chime in about any days / times that are better or worse for yourself if you'd like 
to participate regularly!

### Gem of the Week

This week, we have a neat little gem, from @hboon: [motion-ostruct](https://github.com/hboon/motion-ostruct?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2). Ruby's [OpenStruct](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.1/libdoc/ostruct/rdoc/OpenStruct.html) is one of 
those stdlib data structures that I definitely miss at times in RubyMotion. With [motion-ostruct](https://github.com/hboon/motion-ostruct?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2), 
we don't have to miss it any more.

I'm featuring RubyMotion gems here each week.  Sometimes because they are awesome, and sometimes 
because they need some love. Remember, if you have a gem you'd like featured, just reply to this 
email, or you can PM me in Slack! 

### Community Forum
Great reminder in the community forum this week.  The RubyMotion tool set is accessible for blind 
developers.  Frankie asked for [assistance](http://community.rubymotion.com/t/hello-world-start-here/13/31?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2), and Amir hooked him up with Austin Seraphin, a 
RubyMotion developer who happens to be blind. Austin gave a [fantastic talk](http://confreaks.tv/videos/inspect2014-rubymotion-and-accessibility?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2) at RubyMotion #inspect 
on Accessibility that's worth watching (and rewatching). 

And here's your reminder to introduce yourself on the [Hello World](http://community.rubymotion.com/t/hello-world-start-here/13?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2) post on the community forum!

### App Highlight of the Week
Austin mentioned that his app, [Eyes-Free Fitness](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eyes-free-fitness/id966686576?mt=8&utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2) will be going away at the end of the year. This 
might be your last chance to check it out, and our last chance to feature this 5.0 star rated 
iPhone/iPad app created with RubyMotion.

Psst!!! If you have an app (even if it's not in the App Store) let me know, and I'll add it to 
the list to be featured!

### TWIL (This Week I Learned) Links 

From the iOS Dev Weekly this week, this [article](https://fluffy.es/static-table-view/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2) about Static TableViews caught my attention. 
It reminded me of an old blog post of mine about [Static Tables in Code](https://wndx.com/blog/static-tables-in-code/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=2).  I hope you find it useful.

That's it for this week!
