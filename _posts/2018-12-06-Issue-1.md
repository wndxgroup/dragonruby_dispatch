Well it's finally time. The [RubyMotion Weekly](https://rubymotionweekly.com) Newsletter is set
up and ready to roll. This takes the place of the barely
launched [WNDX School](https://wndx.school) newsletter. I wanted to expand to include
ALL THE THINGS relevant to the entire [RubyMotion](https://rubymotion.com) community. Let
me know what you think?

### New in the School

We have a new set of Motion In Motion episodes up. [RMQ In Depth]( http://drip.la/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNjg0MjExMSIsInRyaWdnZXJfaWQiOiIxMTE5MzQ4ODMiLCJkeW5hbWljX3VybCI6bnVsbCwidXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93bmR4LnNjaG9vbC9wL3JtcSJ9?utm_source=wndx_school&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=rm_weekly&utm_content=new_in_school ) is ready to get you up to speed with this powerful UI library
for RubyMotion. [RMQ - RubyMotion Query](http://rubymotionquery.com) is one of the many parts of Red Potion.

More MiM episodes are coming in the following weeks. If you have
any special requests, just hit reply and let us know. The
[motioninmotion.tv]( http://drip.la/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNjg0MjExMSIsInRyaWdnZXJfaWQiOiI2MTM1NzkwMDEiLCJkeW5hbWljX3VybCI6bnVsbCwidXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9tb3Rpb25pbm1vdGlvbi50diJ9?utm_source=wndx_school&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=rm_weekly&utm_content=1 ) archive remains available, if you'd like to purchase all the
episodes. The ones in the school have been vetted for currency
and the source code has been updated. Why buy the [Complete
Collection]( http://drip.la/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNjg0MjExMSIsInRyaWdnZXJfaWQiOiI2MTk1NDg2NjEiLCJkeW5hbWljX3VybCI6bnVsbCwidXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93bmR4LnNjaG9vbC9wL21vdGlvbi1pbi1tb3Rpb24tY29sbGVjdGlvbiJ9?utm_source=wndx_school&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=rm_weekly&utm_content=1 ) in the school, your wonder? You will have access to ALL
episodes (you'll get a download link) anyway PLUS all future
episodes as they are created.

### Slack Highlights

It seems that [SubEthaEdit]( https://rant.monkeydom.de/posts/2018/11/28/see-is-back?utm_source=wndx_school&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=rm_weekly&utm_content=1 ) is back in the Mac App Store for FREE! And it's been open
sourced. I suspect there will be a lot of people checking out
this great editor. Thanks to Amir for the link!

### Gem of the Week

I'll be featuring RubyMotion gems here each week.
Sometimes because they are awesome, and sometimes because they
need some love. This week, we have one that needs some love -
[motion-screenshots]( https://github.com/clayallsopp/motion-screenshots?utm_source=wndx_school&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=rm_weekly&utm_content=1 ). This gem should be taking the tedium out of creating
screenshots for use in the App Store. Alas, it's not currently
working. It would be great if we could get this one working
again.

### Community Forum

Looks like johnw is having some problems with Universal links.
If anyone can help him out, you can find the discussion here:

[http://community.rubymotion.com/t/universal-links-in-ios/116]( http://community.rubymotion.com/t/universal-links-in-ios/116?utm_source=wndx_school&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=rm_weekly&utm_content=1 )

And don't forget to add your own introduction to the pinned post
while you are there!

### App Highlight of the Week

Our first app for this is a Mac app. [Versatil Markdown]( https://versatilapp.com?utm_source=wndx_school&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=rm_weekly&utm_content=1 ) is a fantastic Markdown editor, written in RubyMotion.

If you have an app you'd like to have highlighted in one of our
newsletters, just hit reply and let me know!

### TIL (Today I learned) Links

Here's a cool set of [iPad Pro tips](https://youtu.be/mtigvHQVQPQ?utm_source=wndx_school&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=rm_weekly&utm_content=1 ) that just popped up on Twitter, thanks to [@reneritchie](https://twitter.com/reneritchie).

That's it for this week!
