### #OPED
Hey folks, we are back. Thanks for being patient while I dealt with the final days, death, and 
funeral of my [brother, Jeff](https://www.cornerstonefuneralhome.com/obituary/olson-jeff?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24).
It's been a rough time for my whole family, and I needed to be there for them.

That said, I don't have a whole lot of school news right now, so let's just get back to the rest 
of the RubyMotion Community news. — [wndxlori](http://www.twitter.com/wndxlori?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24)
 
### #DRGTK: DragonRuby Game Toolkit
 
We kicked off this new section of #RMW just before we took our hiatus and it's dedicated to covering 
the DragonRuby Game Toolkit. We have a couple of items this week:

Born of the bitter experience of shelves of paper documentation just out of date enough to be 
completely useless, we have a rule around here: do not write one word of documentation you're not 
absolutely sure somebody is going to read at some point. OK, that's a bit of a non-sequitur but we 
think you get the point. Documentation is important, but in the right quantity and where possible, 
automated. To that end we have a neat utility from [Martin Kolb](https://github.com/ediathome?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
called the [dragon-ruby-documenter](https://github.com/ediathome/dragon-ruby-documenter?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
which dumps basic DragonRuby documentation. It should be what you need—nothing more and nothing 
less. Thanks, Martin.

If you claim first hand knowledge of [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
when it was originally developed you are either a pretty 
good fibber or really, really old. It's from the mid-1970s and it enabled development of video games 
like [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24). 
In any event, what this world needed was a [CHIP-8 interpreter written in DragonRuby](https://github.com/mikemar10/dragonruby-chip8?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
and that's exactly what [Mike Martin](https://github.com/mikemar10?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
of Austin, Texas has developed. We'd write more about this but we have 
to go and spend some time tracking down .wav files with those 'blip' and 'bloop' sounds Pong used to 
make. They're cute right up to the point they become really annoying.
 
### #MSH: Motioneers Slack Highlights

You are a member of the [Motioneers Slack](https://motioneers.slack.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
team, right? If not, that's a situation you want to put right 
before you read any further. With that out of the way, we have two items for you this week: 

First up from [Ben Eggett](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/UJ9A0QBEJ?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
is a simple, concise,  step-by-step procedure for running [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
on the [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
platform. Retro-wha...?  Yes, we had to look it up, too. Y'know the cheerfully-named [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
single board computer? RetroPie turns said Raspberry Pi into a retro-gaming machine, which sounds 
like a great idea to us. Ben's post covers the use of the  RetroPie ROM facility to run DragronRuby. 
A RetroPie ROM is basically a file which contains a copy of an old game console which is then used by 
RetroPie to emulate that game console.  Check out [Ben's procedure here in the #gamedev channel](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C1SUQ4T0A/p1558761337009700?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24).

Next, [Brett Walker](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U07D6P1D2?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
kicked off a helpful thread when he asked "is support for RubyMotion in [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
completely gone?"  The short answer is NO it's not gone although a small fix was required as reported 
by [Amir Rajan](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U07C64R8C?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24). 
By the time you read this, that fix should be done and RubyMotion support in Travis CI 
should be good to go.

### #GOTW: Gem of the Week

We'll start with [Morgan Schweers](https://github.com/cyberfox?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
of [CyberFOX Software](http://cyberfox.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
out of Seattle whose #GOTW is [Fusemotion](https://github.com/cyberfox/fusemotion?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24). 
It's a really elegant way of marrying RubyMotion to [MacFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24), 
which allows you to extend native macOS file handling capabilities to third party filesystems. Morgan includes a RubyMotion-MacFUSE sample app to 
help jumpstart your own work along these lines.

We follow with Dave Anderson's recommendation for a tool to install multiple versions of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
including version 11. Dave likes Calgary-based [Robots and Pencils](https://www.robotsandpencils.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
simply-named [xcodes](https://github.com/RobotsAndPencils/xcodes/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24).  
Thanks for the tip, Dave, and it looks really good. By the way, we love featuring Alberta-based shops.

Do you think your contribution to modern software development has been horrendously overlooked by #GOTW? 
First, our apologies for that oversight. To make amends please LET US KNOW and we'll be happy to 
feature it in an upcoming edition of #RMW.

### #COMM: Community

It's our week for twofers as we have two items here in #COMM as well:

Our friends over at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
had an interesting post by [Andrey Aksenov](https://blog.jetbrains.com/ruby/author/duuusha/r?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
back at the end of last month: 
Learn RubyMine with IDE Features Trainer.  It's for those of us who use 10% of [RubyMine's](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
features 90% of the time and never stop to learn about the productivity gold mines which are in the other 90% of 
the features. This post has everything you need to kick start your learning curve and get on the road 
to knowing exactly what all of RubyMine can do.  

Boy, some subjects have come up this week which have required liberal use of Wikipedia to sort out.
(You do donate to Wikipedia, right? If not, imagine a world without it. But we digress.)  This time 
out we had to (re-)educate ourselves on [Synthwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthwave?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24). 
Huh? Think of the incidental music from Miami Vice 
(the original TV show, not the movie) and you're pretty close. But we also didn't know there is a 
colour scheme associated with Synthwave. It's true. Have a desire to make your [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
all Synthwavy?  [Robb Owen](https://github.com/robb0wen?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) did and here are the fruits of his labours: synthwave-vscode. You'll either love it or wish 
you had the last 75 seconds of your life back.

### #TWIL: This Week I Learned

Yep, another twofer.  We're on the verge of overstaying our welcome, so we'll be brief:

The sage [Soroush Khanlou](https://twitter.com/khanlou?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
wrote about [Coordinators](http://khanlou.com/2015/01/the-coordinator/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
a while back but has since refined his thinking in 
that regard and provides an update in [Coordinators Redux](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24).
It's smart writing which makes for smart reading for smart people.

Also, we found a great resource called [Mac Open Web](https://macopenweb.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
by [Brian Warren](https://github.com/good?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24) 
which is "a collection of open and indie Mac, iOS, and web apps that help promote the open web."  The Big A always needs a little 
pushback on their 'walled garden' view of the world. You can even contribute if you want and we think 
that would be great if you did.  

### That's a Wrap

If it's unthinkable you might miss a future issue of #RMW, then think about [subscribing](https://www.getdrip.com/forms/482172082/submissions/new?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com).
It's simply the right thing to do. You can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wndxschool?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wndxschool?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com) 
or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wndxschool?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=24&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com) 
and we really hope you to see you on those platforms. 

Until then...well, let's just say we're so glad to be back. We missed this place.
