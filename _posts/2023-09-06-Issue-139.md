## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>The <em>Other</em> Tools You Need</b></div>

There's a surprising number of not-strictly-development-related technologies needed in order to create and launch a successful app. These tools include, in no particular order:

<ol>
<li>Web page/site</li>
<li>App prototyping tool</li>
<li>Design tool</li>
<li>Email marketing service</li>
<li>App testing tool</li>
</ol>

This is not an exhaustive list, either. This surprises and sometimes shocks the people I teach in <em>6 Pack Apps</em>. While you might be able to squeak through the process by avoiding a couple of them, your launch will be much simpler, happen faster and be less prone to "oops, didn't know I needed that" if you just surrender to the necessity up front.

This is the reason for my current series of &lsquo;webinar-like&rsquo; working sessions. I'm demonstrating the use of tools, using them to create both an app and the assets needed to actually get launched! See immediately below for more info.

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

Here is our pick from one of the two main RubyMotion/DRGTK chat spaces:

* <b>Discord</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Amir Rajan and the gang have been busy&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;as usual!&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and they [just rolled out DRGTK&nbsp;5.6](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/815289039338340414/1148194446081536040?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). Be the first kid on the block to have it!

It's a great idea to give one or both of these high-IQ communities a try&mdash;they're <b>absolutely free</b> and you'll undoubtedly be welcomed with open arms.

## TWIL &#8212; This Week I Learned ...

Unless you have been under a rock ü™® which is ten feet under water for the last few months, AI is everything, everywhere, all at once. While on the one hand ignorance is bliss&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;don't ask us how we know&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;on the other you may be of the mind it's time to get your feet at least damp, if not completely soaked with AI. Fortunately, there's a  really useful application which Elijah Major describes both succinctly and clearly in his new video <em>[AI for the Command-Line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw0SH7AHIFI&utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. But don't stop there&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Elijah has a lot of other [neat videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ElijahManor?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) on a wide variety of subjects.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

We somehow missed this on International Womens' Day, but why wait for a specific, arbitrary day on a calender to celebrate women in general and in particular share this awesome book: <em>[Women in Gaming: 100 Professionals at Play](https://www.thevideogamelibrary.org/book/women-in-gaming-100-professionals-of-play?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. Thanks very much to [The Video Game Library](https://mstdn.social/@thevglibrary/109989123480598686?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) on Mastodon for tipping us off to this one.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On ...

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com"><img src="https://media.tenor.com/2gyJVMt_L6wAAAAC/pong-video-game.gif" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; width: 50%;"></a>

It's hard the deny the perennial appeal of <em>[Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;or explain it, for that matter&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;but as time goes by it just seems to get bigger and get more attention. So forget previously-only-renderable-on-a-supercomputer graphics of <em>Gran Turismo</em> or <em>Tour of Duty</em>, gimme eight-bit graphics, that funky little bleeping sound and the weirdo, dodgy physics.

However, all that notwithstanding you can't help but be swept up in <em>Pong</em>-mania, there's a great, [three-part tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-vrJzU7eMJxZew3XXknihB2vYDI9YCyy&utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) on rolling your own with the DragonRuby Gaming Toolkit. Dodgy physics and all, hopefully.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

We remember the first few stabs at consumer-grade voice control: yelling at our car repeatedly and progressively louder to turn on the radio&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;which resulted only in the windshield wipers coming on &nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;is a memory we would just as soon forget.

However things have come a long way since then, as described in <em>[Building for Voice Control](https://www.swiftjectivec.com/voice-control-accessibility-tweaks-ios/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> by Jordan Morgan where he leads off by claiming it &ldquo;allows you to do ... well, basically <em>everything</em> on your iPhone using only your voice&rdquo;. Jordan, the floor is yours.

## HAHA &#8212; And They All Laughed
