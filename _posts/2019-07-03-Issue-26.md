### #OPED

No newsletter last week, because I was off camping in the mountains with my husband and our two dogs.
Somehow I managed to forget to mention I was going on vacation in the June 19th edition.  Oops, sorry. 

Didn't realize how burnt out I was, either, until after I got back.  Suddenly my concentration and 
focus are sharp, and the amount of work I've managed to tackle since our return is more than I managed 
to get done in a whole week before we left. Don't underestimate the impact burnout and stress has on 
your ability to function.  After a little over a week off (Monday was a holiday here in Canada, too), 
I'm back at full function, but that week was *completely* off.  No email, no phone calls, no work at all. 

If you are feeling any of these [signs of burnout](https://health.usnews.com/health-care/for-better/articles/2019-01-30/when-to-take-a-mental-health-break?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26), 
make sure you pay attention, and take a mental health break. -- [wndxlori](https://twitter.com/wndxlori?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26)
 
### #FITS: Featured in the School

We're feverishly getting ready for the official launch of our [RubyMotion Testing In Depth](https://wndx.school/p/rubymotion-testing-in-depth?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
course. We are really excited to get this out the door and into the wild.

One of the really pleasant side benefits of this background work is that we come across all manner 
of neat little snippets like this one from [Coderwall](https://coderwall.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
in 2016. It's a way to check for existing 
instances of [UIAlertView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uialertview?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
in apps which run with versions of iOS prior to iOS 8 and without the need 
for having to setup a full blown feature test. Check out [Testing the presence of a UIAlertView in 
RubyMotion on iOS7](https://coderwall.com/p/hle4mq/testing-the-presence-of-a-uialertview-in-rubymotion-on-ios7?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26). 
Now, I know that UIAlertView is deprecated, but this is still an interesting pattern to consider for testing.

If you already have the early, ill-defined symptoms of [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26), 
it's probably because the advance price of $25 for __RubyMotion Testing In Depth__ won't last much longer. That's an absolute steal for three full hours of really valuable content. Get it while it's hot!

### #DRGTK: DragonRuby Game Toolkit

This week, from San Francisco-based [Danny Page](https://twitter.com/dannypage?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26), 
we have [a sample app](https://gist.github.com/dannypage/df8885cc2dac5ce79ab5c29d2ac8a5a6?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
demonstrating some interesting 
capabilities which you will undoubtedly find useful at some point. This includes the inclusion of 
new classes, the creation of buttons to update state, management of the update loop and effortlessly 
adding new colour schemes.

What we're keen to know is at which gig Danny is going to be using these capabilities—[NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
or [Skrimmage Sports](https://twitter.com/SkrimmageSports?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
or maybe something stealth on which he's working? Any of the above would be intriguing. 
 
### #MSH: Motioneers Slack Highlights

You may have gotten tired of hearing about it, but we're far from tired of reminding you, if you are 
not already a member of the [Motioneers Slack](https://motioneers.slack.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
team then becoming one is something you should really do. 
Or legitimately fear missing out on items like the following from team member [Lantao Liu](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U6SHLUFT7?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26):

[Recently in the #general channel](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1561644596178900?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
Lantao lamented the fact that [Clay Allsopp's](https://www.clayallsopp.com/about/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
[motion-toolbox.com](https://github.com/clayallsopp/motion-toolbox.com?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
collection of libraries and wrappers wasn't coming back any time soon. Seeing that as more of an 
opportunity than a problem, Lantao forked the project, made some minor updates and—**PRESTO!**—the 
[Motion Toolbox is reborn](https://motion-toolbox.github.io/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26). 

Thanks, Lantao, and I'm sure a lot of folks are going to find this really useful.

### #GOTW: Gem of the Week

This week's #GOTW comes to us from [David Larrabee](https://github.com/squidpunch?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
who has come up with [motion-pusher](https://github.com/squidpunch/motion-pusher?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26), 
a RubyMotion wrapper for [Tom Kemp](https://github.com/TomKemp?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26)'s 
[libPusher](https://github.com/pusher/libPusher?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
which, in turn, provides an Objective-C interface to [Pusher Channels](https://pusher.com/channels?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26).

We have to admit that some of us had to do a little digging to understand the implications of all that. 
Apparently, what you really need to know is that __Channels__ provide you with flexible pub/sub messaging, 
live user lists, access control and integrations with the likes of [Slack](http://www.slack.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26).  
Sounds pretty good to us if you can do all that and not leave the cozy confines of Ruby code for your app development.

Would you like your gem to be featured in #GOTW? By all means, **let us know** and we'll be happy to tell 
the world in an upcoming edition of #RMW.

### #COMM: Community

We have a couple of items for #COMM in this week's issue:

From none other than [The Big A](http://developer.apple.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
comes word that "links generated for apps on the App Store now begin 
with apps.apple.com." There's not much more to it than that, but [here's the article](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=06142019a&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
from their [News and Updates](https://developer.apple.com/news/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
section. You certainly can't fault them for being too verbose, at least. Make sure you 
start updating all your App Store links (although the old ones still redirect).

Also, from the [Community Forum](http://community.rubymotion.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26), 
we also have a very [thoughtfully written question](http://community.rubymotion.com/t/could-i-use-rubymotion-for/231?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
from [Jan Jacobs](http://community.rubymotion.com/u/Lincee?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
about the potential of RubyMotion for developing a new sharing app. [Amir](http://community.rubymotion.com/u/amirrajan?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
and [Andrew](http://community.rubymotion.com/u/andrewhavens?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
promptly weighed in with helpful answers.

Not joined the Community Forum yet? You really ought to, and you're going to love the price.

### #AHOTW: App Highlight of the Week

As with the previous edition of the #RMW, this could also have appeared in the #DRGTK section but we 
chose to include it here as a reminder we would love to feature **your** app in this space, too.

This week, [Sean Scally](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U0ARCNCRW?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
contributes a 'serviceable but boring' (his words, not ours!) version of the 
arcade classic [Breakout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game)?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
originally from 1976. To which we can only say what goes around (eventually) 
comes around.  Again. And again. Seriously, though, if so-old-it's-new-again Breakout is what you 
crave, [here's where you can find it](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C1SUQ4T0A/p1561433464095900?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26).

Now, if we could just find that greatest hits album from KC and The Sunshine Band, our lives would 
be complete. Utterly lame, but complete.

### #TWIL: This Week I Learned

We should have temporarily renamed this section TWIR (as in 'Reminded'). This is because we were 
recently reminded the word 'computer' originally had **nothing** to do with the things we now carry 
around in our pockets and from which we rarely glance away. It was actually the job description for 
a person who manually did the math (probably with a [slide rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26)) 
for large scale, compute-intensive 
projects like the space program. The reminder came via a [tweet](https://twitter.com/hashnode/status/1141738245484683267?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
by [Hashnode](https://twitter.com/hashnode?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
and we thank them for that little trip down memory lane. 

Want an even more vivid illustration of a 'computer' of the human kind? Check out the excellent 2016 
movie [Hidden Figures](https://www.foxmovies.com/movies/hidden-figures?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=26) 
starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae. We just love these ladies. Well worth 
126 minutes of your time and then some. It is the 'summer of space' after all.
  
### That's a Wrap
