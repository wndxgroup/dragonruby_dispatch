## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Not Really Feeling It</b></div>

I missed sending out a newsletter last time, sorry about that folks. You see ... well ... my Dad died. So I‚Äôm still processing all of that, and helping my mom. Therefore you'll understand, I'm sure, I‚Äôm still not really feeling much like writing this time. I'll just say this:

Miss ya, Dad.

## FITS &#8212; Featured in the School

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>New Game Course</b></div>

We're excited to say that the WNDX School <b>finally</b> has a new game course coming, from the talented [Cameron Gose](https://twitter.com/cgose001?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). It‚Äôs currently in final review, and we're confident that we‚Äôll be launching it in the next couple of weeks. If you‚Äôd like a sneak peek&mdash;<em>and you are willing to write up your experience with the course</em>&mdash;hit reply and let us know so we can add you to the beta test list.

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

Here are this issue's selections from two of the finer RubyMotion/DRGTK chat spaces:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_(1983_video_game)?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/bomberman-400x542.png" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; width: 50%;"></a>

* <b>Discord</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Remember <em>[Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_(1983_video_game)?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>? Well, it came out in 1983 which means you could be up to <em>40 years old</em> and still be able to say &ldquo;that's a little before my time&rdquo;. In any event, it's an oldy-but-goody and it has just been [recreated with DragonRuby](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/1091235655369113610?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com).

* </a><b>Slack</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;There is typically no better conversation starter in any sort of forum than &ldquo;so what's everybody working on?&rdquo; In this particular case, we have the affable [Lucas Haley](https://twitter.com/lucashaley?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) to thank. [Read the answers](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1678397660499929?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) others have provided&mdash;or perhaps consider adding your own? There are some really nice apps written in RubyMotion!

You will find participating in either and/or both of these two forums is a real benefit and the price (that is, <b>free</b>!) is certainly right.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On...

Speaking of chat spaces there was also mention of the DragonRuby Game Toolkit on reddit recently. Amir intriguingly subtitled the post <em>[More Portal Shenanigans and How You Can Use Them to Reach Higher Places](https://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/12msji1/dragonruby_game_toolkit_more_portal_shenanigans/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. ü§î Guess you'll just have to go and find out for yourself. Nice sound effects, though.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

<img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/sonic-and-buddy-400x550.png" style="float: right; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 20px; width: 50%;">

The mind boggles at the thought of a &lsquo;buddy mode&rsquo;&mdash;how many games can you think of which could be enhanced in this way? ‚û°Ô∏è

Or a variation on that theme where you sit on the passenger side of the car and go for a ride-along in <em><a>[Gran Turismo](https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</a></em> or settle in to the first officer's seat in <em><a>[X-Plane](https://www.x-plane.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</a></em> to get a feel for how the &lsquo;professionals&rsquo; do it?

## APP &#8212; All Things App

One of the eternal, burning questions is what kind of app should you write? Haven't all the good ideas already been taken? Not in a million years. However instead of broadening your outlook you might have to narrow your search&mdash;focus in on a single PITA problem and solve it really effectively. A great example is <em>[Video for Ants](https://techhub.social/@sjs/110133355608362420?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. üêú The length and breadth of what it does is compress videos to make them  fit on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). That's it. That's the entire app. Now, wasn't that easy?

<div style="background: #74AFAA; padding: 15px; border-style: solid; border-width: 2px; border-color: black; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 10px; margin-top: 30px;" ><span style="color: #333333;">Do you have a DragonRuby-related product or service you would like to get in front of well over 1,200 raving DragonRuby-istas? üêâ If so, please <a href="mailto:lori@wndx.com?Subject=DRD131 Enquiry">get in touch</a>...we would love to help you get the word out in a sponsored spot like this!&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #FEBFA2; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; border-color: #666666">Sponsored</span></span></div>

## TWIL &#8212; This Week I Learned...

If you've ever wished that your command line understood your own quirky, one-off vernacular, then you're going to love  <small><code>alias</code></small>. You'll have your CLI speaking your language before you know it.

## HAHA &#8212; And They All Laughed

We'd be lyin' if we said we hadn't done this at least a time or two (or three):
