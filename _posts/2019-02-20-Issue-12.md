On the off chance that anyone missed it... The Apple Developer portal is going to start requiring 
Two Factor Authentication next week.  You should have received an email from Apple about this with 
the subject line "Two-Factor Authentication Required Soon".  There's a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&v=YB1n2UpFzGA)
 from [Ren√© Ritchie](https://twitter.com/reneritchie?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com), 
where he has gathered some of the best advice for people who have multiple accounts, because it is 
somewhat challenging to make this work for multiple iCloud accounts. 
 
### Featured in the School

We are at T minus 6 weeks until the launch of the next edition of 6 Pack Apps.  Next week, I'll have a
VERY brief pre-sale, just for my newsletter folks.  So watch for next week's newsletter!

Also, it was pointed out to me last week, that the newsletter is supposed to be where people go to 
find DISCOUNTS and COUPONS for the school. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Oops.  Well here we go. There will be one of these 
coming every month from now on.  This month, since I've been so tardy, we have a bonus 20% off 
coupon that is available for the next week, or until we hit the limit. And the code is... 

NEWSLTR1220

Apply that code at checkout to any of the courses in the [WNDX School](https://wndx.school/courses?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com) to get 20% off, until 11:55 pm 
on Feb 26. **Sorry folks on the web, it's expired already. If you want one to take advantage of the 
discounts, you will need to sign up for the newsletter.**
 
### Slack Highlights

Did you know that you can quite easily add libraries written in C to your RubyMotion projects?  
[Amir points out](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1548792289324300?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)
that you can always fall back on a C lib (provided one exists), if all you can find 
is a Swift-only CocoaPod.  There's even a little [sample app](https://github.com/amirrajan/rubymotionobjectivec?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)
to show you how.  

And if you haven't signed up for Slack yet, you can get access by going to [motioneers.herokuapp.com](http://motioneers.herokuapp.com/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12).

### Gem of the Week

Ok, here is one more project from Twitter for our Gem of the Week.  TIP or [Twitter Image Pipeline](https://github.com/twitter/ios-twitter-image-pipeline?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com) 
is a streamlined framework for fetching and storing images in an application. While Twitter has 
some crazy needs for performance, we can all benefit from their work on this pipeline that makes 
use of in-memory and on disk caches, as well as managing network access and keeping the caches tuned.
 

I'm featuring RubyMotion gems here each week.  Sometimes because they are awesome, and sometimes 
because they need some love. Remember, if you have a gem you'd like featured, just reply to this 
email, or you can PM me in Slack! 

### Community

The next RubyMotion release, [5.17 is imminent](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RS0VA/p1550524153004900?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com), 
but awaiting the finalization of the new Apple Watch 
chip architecture work. This is holding up a simd fix, so if that problem is an issue for you, hop 
in to Slack and get Amir to hook you up with a pre-release. 

I completely failed at reminding people about the monthly RubyMotion Meetup last week ü•∫.  Sorry, 
I was busy with puppy üê∂ school, and was going to miss it anyway, but it should have got a mention.
But here's the [video for January's meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&v=r-r4pKGvjNc)
for your enjoyment today!  

And here's your reminder to introduce yourself on the [Hello World](http://community.rubymotion.com/t/hello-world-start-here/13?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12) post on the community forum!

### App Highlight of the Week

This week we have another app from Martin Kolb. [Gapped](https://gapped.de/?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com) 
is an app to create gapped texts and cloze 
tests on macOS. Gapped texts, CTests or cloze tests are one of the most often used classroom 
exercises. Especially when teaching foreign languages gapped texts can be used in many ways. But 
creating gapped texts can be rather tedious. Gapped is an application for macOS which lets you 
create gapped texts in moments.
 
Psst!!! I'm OUT OF more apps to feature again, so if you have an app (even if it's not in any of 
the App Stores) send me the details, and I'll add it to the list to be featured!

### TWIL (This Week I Learned) Links 

TWIL about Travis CI build stages.  Here's an interesting article on [deploying to CocoaPods with Travis CI](https://medium.com/@mxcl/deploying-to-cocoapods-with-travis-1150b1008342?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=12&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com).
