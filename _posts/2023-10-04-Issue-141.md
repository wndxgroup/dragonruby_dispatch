## FITS &#8212; Featured in the School

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>And Now for Something Completely Familiar</b></div>

This newsletter &mdash; <em>DragonRuby Dispatch</em> &mdash; is continuing to focus on specifics of developing apps and games. Which is to say, specifically, <b>coding</b>. If you find this isn't for you, you can easily unsubscribe using the big blue button right down there. ‚¨áÔ∏è

This newsletter wouldn‚Äôt exist without the backing of the WNDX School. If you are just embarking on your coding journey, you might find <em>[Programming Fundamentals with Ruby](https://wndx.school/p/ruby-programming-fundamentals?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> to be useful. Based on the popular live workshops from [Canada Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com), this online course carries on a bit further, so you can start applying your new coding skills to something useful right away!

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

<a href="https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/1140304236828164116?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/not-gran-turismo-but-not-bad-either.gif" style="float: right; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 20px; width: 33%;"></a>

While it's not quite <em>[Gran Turismo](https://www.gran-turismo.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>, it's possible to rough out the basics of a driving game with just two things: [Sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) and [Bezier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B√©zier_curve?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). This was from a while back on the Discord channel, but there was a bunch of other stuff happening at that time. It's still cool though! Thanks to DragonRider <code>jujule</code> for this one.

Yes, that beloved/reviled red dot should be showing up on a <em>Settings</em> icon near you shortly, if it hasn't already. That's right, <em>[Sonoma](https://www.apple.com/macos/sonoma/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> has arrived. But put that mouse/pad/trackball down and back slowly away &mdash; no <em>Sonoma</em> for <b>you</b> quite yet. Or so was the conclusion of [a Motioneers thread](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1695944084177969?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com).

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

You'd think that we might be reluctant to recommend a &lsquo;competing&rsquo; newsletter. Actually, we're <b>more</b> than happy to pass along the particulars of <em>[Graphics Programming Weekly](https://www.jendrikillner.com/post/graphics-programming-weekly-issue-304/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> edited by [Jendrik Illner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jendrikillner/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). Well worth your time and attention.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On ...

This is so, y'know ... 2022 ... but we stumbled across the link again and remembered why we saved it way back when. üë¥üèª It's a crisp little game called <em>[Shadows](https://amirrajan.itch.io/shadows?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. It was our good friend Amir Rajan's submission to the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org). Perhaps you'll be inspired to submit <em>your</em> game to the GGJ which is coming up in January of 2024. That's sooner than you think.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

Because we have a borderline unnatural addiction to collecting pretty &mdash; <em>and open-source!</em> &mdash; design elements, here are the <em>[Phosphor](https://phosphoricons.com/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> icons. If you can't find that for which you're looking in the 7000+ in the set, well you're not likely of this world. ü™ê  Thanks to [Viktor Nagornyy](https://me.dm/@viktor/110981798694848159?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) for this tip.

Remember, too, that nothing says &lsquo;put together&rsquo; more than having a clean, simple and consistent icon language for your app.

## TWIL &#8212; This Week [We] Learned ...

If you're thinking <code>Cmd-C/Cmd-V</code> versus drag-n-drop is a &lsquo;Coke versus Pepsi, what's the difference&rsquo; type deal, you may want to re-evaluate that position based on [this recent toot](https://hachyderm.io/@adamhill/109747498683054765?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) üí® from Hachyderm on Mastodon. Spoiler alert: it's <b>not</b> what the cool kids do.

## HAHA &#8212; And They All Laughed

It was National Coffee Day ‚òïÔ∏è this past Sunday, so we're dunking this biscotti from [Juozas Kaziukƒónas](https://www.facebook.com/groups/it.humor.and.memes/permalink/9662924480399916?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) in our java. Anybody out there have first-hand experience with what this is like? Asking for a friend.
