I'm going to start working on creating a couple of wrapper apps (iOS & Android) for a Rails application that I have built for a client. Eventually, the creation of these apps will be turned into an new course in the school.  If you have any interest in this process, hit reply and let me know, and I'll add you to my "behind the scenes" list, where I'll be posting updates of the play-by-play as these apps are created.  -- [wndxlori](https://twitter.com/wndxlori?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30)\
#FITS---Featured in the School
------------------------------

We finally have a winner and our congratulations go to [Bryan Konowitz](https://twitter.com/bkonowitz?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) who correctly answered our quiz question. For those keeping score at home, the correct answer was [Robert X. Cringley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_X._Cringely?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30). Bryan takes home **FREE** enrolment in *[RubyMotion Testing In Depth](https://wndx.school/p/rubymotion-testing-in-depth?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30)*. What's that worth? Well, we think it's priceless, of course.

If you have ever wanted an opportunity to meet [WNDXLori](https://twitter.com/wndxlori?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) in person and you happen to be in or around [Edmonton, Alberta](https://goo.gl/maps/o4vraoakeWAokpyUA?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) on August 10th, you are in luck!  Lori will be leading a *[DragonRuby/RubyMotion Jumpstart](https://yegrb.com/events/8?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30)* as part of the [YEGRB](https://yegrb.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) August Meetup. It gets going at 1.00 pm sharp and it will be graciously hosted by [Startup Edmonton](https://www.startupedmonton.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) at their HQ. That's in the beautiful old [Mercer Warehouse](http://mercerwarehouse.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) located at [10359 104th St.](https://goo.gl/maps/vEgq5NQoYB328P8X7?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) in downtown Edmonton.

Attendance is free but you will need to RSVP. You can do that [from the Meetup's page](https://yegrb.com/events/8?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30).

#DRGTK---DragonRuby Game Toolkit
------------------------------

[Jack Oatley](https://twitter.com/f_oatley?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) is once again hosting [LowRezJam](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2019?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) on [itch.io](https://itch.io/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30). It runs from August 1st through August 17th.  To support the event [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) is providing---**get this!**---an entirely **FREE** license for the *Game Jam* edition of the [DRGTK](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtka?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30). Once you have [downloaded it](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2019/topic/512286/free-dragonruby-gtk-license-to-jam-with?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) all you have to run the binary for Mac, Linux or Windows. [Amir](https://twitter.com/amirrajan?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) has even thoughtfully chosen to include a 64x64 sample app which will kickstart your LowRezJam efforts. Seem like a win-win: developers get a free license for the LowRezJam and DragonRuby gets a little exposure for the DRGTK.

Also, Leo Kiisi (AKA [Goalaleo](https://twitter.com/goalaleo?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30)) brought up a [very good point](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C1SUQ4T0A/p1563938654003900?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) regarding his Finnish/Swedish keyboard layout. It has both the tilde and backtick characters behind modifier keys. As a result, he is not able to get the DRGTK console to open. This triggered a double-barrelled response from [Amir](https://twitter.com/amirrajan?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) who has both added it to the backlog *and* [provided a workaround](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C1SUQ4T0A/p1563938918009000?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) that should move things along for Leo until a more permanent fix can be delivered.

#MSH---Motioneers Slack Highlights
--------------------------------

From the Motioneers Slack, this week, we have a couple of #RMW-worthy items:

First up, [RubyMotion 6.2 has been released](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1564107917025600?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30)! This includes support for Xcode 10.3; 64 bit SDKs for the compilation of legacy apps; some internal updates to support the new Catalina Apple Watch chips as well a host of other updates. [WNDXLori](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U1E9087PE?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) also provided [some tips](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1564169410027200?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) to make upgrading even simpler.

As is often the case with upgrades, there were some minor gotchas which surfaced.  In particular, [Andrew Havens](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U056FTZ7R?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) was having trouble with the [CoreSimulatorService](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1564186220027800?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30).  You many want to check out the entire chatty thread on the subject or, for the severely time constrained, you can jump right to [Amir](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U07C64R8C?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30)'s recommendation to [reinstall the simulators](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1564260564037600?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30).

This is just one more illustration of the benefit of being a member of the [Motioneers Slack team](https://motioneers.slack.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30). Become a member today if you haven't already and join in the conversation.

#GOTW---Gem of the Week
---------------------

It seems like more often than not here in the #RMW we have an opportunity to feature posts from [Martin Kolb](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U2T2S5KG9?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) and this week is no exception. He has [implemented a 'notarize' task](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RS2D8/p1564397554010900?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) in the OSX template based on a repurposed custom build script. The fruits of his labours can be found on [his page on GitHub](https://github.com/ediathome/rubymotion-templates?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30).

#COMM---Community
---------------

Don't you love it when a problem almost solves itself? We do. There was [a tweet](https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1153805577312591878?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) this week from [Paul Haddad](https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) where he said "*[y]ou can no longer open [DMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Disk_Image?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30)s if they aren't notarized, even if the app within it is.*" We love the fact he refers to it as a "*nanny feature*" which seems to describe the situation perfectly. That said, there is a subsequent [tweetversation](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tweetversation&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) where the issue is [further explored](https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1153820526038532101?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30).

With all the badmouthing that Twitter gets these days, there are still good examples of it facilitating tightly focused conversations which are **really** helpful. We only wish there were more of them as opposed to the usual two polar opposite points-of-view shouting insults past each other. *Sigh.*

#AHOTW---App Highlight of the Week
--------------------------------

Just so you know we would likely have featured this A as #AHOTW on the strength of the name alone: [Flying Sheep Hunt](https://jasemagee.itch.io/flying-sheep-hunt?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30). It's by [Jason Magee](https://twitter.com/jasemagee?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) of [Granite Games](https://granitegames.gg/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) which is based on the lovely isle of [Guernsey](https://www.google.ca/maps/search/guernsey/@49.4697517,-2.5618423,12z?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30). This is the place where apparently the sheep, in addition to being wool on the outside and mutton on this inside, also **FLY**. We're booking our ticket now so we can see this for ourselves.

All kidding aside, though, we love this simple little shooter game built with [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30). Thanks for that, Jason.

#TWIL---This Week I Learned
-------------------------

This is one of those 'holy crap' #TWILs you really have to see for yourself to believe. It's from [Leigh-Ann Friedel](https://twitter.com/lafriedel?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) and you really aren't going to believe your eyes.

By way of example, do you find cryptocurrencies utterly baffling? We do, and to be honest, the Wikipedia entry ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30)) is kind of over our heads as well. [TL;DR](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30) territory for sure. What we want is a simple explanation. **Problem solved.** Turns out you can get that from Wikipedia, too, simply by substituting the word *simple* for the language. Thusly, our example for a simple explanation of cryptocurrencies, you would use [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=30). Try it out for yourself. We know. Holy crap.

Besides, that's probably all you were going to read of that long one anyway. Thanks for this, Leigh-Ann!

That's a Wrap!
