## OPED &#8212; The Year in Review

Some things from this past year‚Äôs newletters that <em>you</em> liked, some that <em>we</em> liked, and a few things that never made the cut but really <b>should have</b>!

<div style="font-size: large; text-align: left; padding-top: 20px;"><b>DRGTK Celebrated</b></div>

In 2023, DragonRuby‚Äôs rankings have skyrocketed. In Amir's [2023 Year End Review](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk/devlog/655686/2023-year-end-review?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) the engine consistently ranks extremely high under <em>Popular</em> (currently #11), <em>Best Selling</em> (currently #10) and <em>Highest Rated</em> (currently #3). This will only continue to improve with every passing day as more and more people discover DragonRuby.

Amir and team powered out an astonishing 20 releases in just the first six months of 2023, with many new features, culminating in the release of DRGTK 5.0. They slowed down &mdash; a bit &mdash; in the latter half of the year with a mere 13 releases. üò±

<div style="font-size: large; text-align: left; padding-top: 20px;"><b>The Year Ahead</b></div>

The coming year has all the hallmarks of an exciting one. May I wish you all a very happy and prosperous 2024!

## THE BEST OF 2023 üèÜ

<div style="font-size: large; text-align: left; padding-top: 20px;"><b>AI is <em>Everywhere</em></b></div>
<div style="font-size: small; text-align: left; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 5px;"><em>DRD130: April 19, 2023</em></div>

Seems like this year AI was cropping up <b>everywhere</b>. This humble newsletter was no exception. It did seem like a lot of you were interested in a couple of the tools with built-in AI that I posted about. They were [Warp](https://app.warp.dev/referral/LQZL4G?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) terminal and [Arc](https://arc.net/gift/19e35387?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) browser. I am still using these, months later &mdash; in fact, they are now my &lsquo;defaults&rsquo;, so how about that?

<div style="font-size: large; text-align: left; padding-top: 20px;"><b>Color Doggy</b></div>
<div style="font-size: small; text-align: left; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 5px;"><em>DRD129: April 5, 2023</em></div>

It's &ldquo;your loyal color helper&rdquo;. It's a super simple app while still scratching an itch for a lot of people&mdash;almost always a winning combination.

To that end, what super simple app could you start building today?

<div style="font-size: large; text-align: right; padding-top: 20px;"><b>Playdate</b></div>
<div style="font-size: small; text-align: right; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 5px;"><em>DRD133: June 14, 2023</em></div>

<a href="https://play.date?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/playdate-400x400.png" style="float: right; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 20px; width: 33%;"></a>

We are pretty sure we have previously mentioned the new <em>[Playdate](https://play.date?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> handheld game system which is currently taking [pre-orders](https://shop.play.date?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) for &ldquo;late 2023&rdquo; delivery. Looks pretty cool&mdash;particularly the [little hand crank](https://youtu.be/HdF3CnFvxg4?t=35&utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) on the right-hand side.

In any event, they're busy &lsquo;cranking out&rsquo; games for it that they'll deliver automatically via wifi &lsquo;while you sleep&rsquo;. That said, we're not sure in a collaboration which includes companies called [Panic](https://panic.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) and [Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)  there will be a whole lot of sleeping going on.

In case you're wondering why we're bringing this up now, our memories were recently jogged by [this toot](https://xoxo.zone/@robotspacer/110442881983662823?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) üí® from Mike Piontek.

<b>UPDATE</b>: Playdate is now taking firm orders for &ldquo;Estimated delivery: January 2024 (please add up to 2-4 weeks for non-U.S. destinations)&rdquo; which sounds like they've just about hit their stated milestones from earlier this year.

<div style="font-size: large; text-align: left; padding-top: 20px;"><b>Playmicrocade's Road Trip Edition</b></div>
<div style="font-size: small; text-align: left; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 5px;"><em>DRD135: July 12, 2023</em></div>

When we take a retrospective look at which DRD stories really strike a chord with readers, it's seems it's most often when we feature something related to the good old days of lo-res arcade games.  There seems to be an insatiable demand for everything 80s&mdash;often by those who didn't actually have to live through them. üò±

Anywho ... we just about spit-taked our double decaf cappuccino when we stumbled across Microarcade's build-your-own nano-sized arcade machine <em>[Road Trip Edition](https://playmicrocade.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. Learn to solder, learn to code in C++  and end the &lsquo;are we there yet?&rsquo; blues in one simple purchase!

<div style="font-size: large; text-align: right; padding-top: 20px;"><b>Commodore 64's Original Maze Generator</b></div>
<div style="font-size: small; text-align: right; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 5px;"><em>DRD140: September 20, 2023</em></div>

Speaking of what can be accomplished with one line of code, how about an [old school maze generator](https://mstdn.io/@codewiz/110608699859366540?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) as was found in the original user manual of the <em>Commodore 64</em>. Oh, yes, and in case you're wondering what the hell that is (and you're dating yourself if you are) check out the classic <em>Honest Competition</em> commercial from 1983. Click the GIF to see the full, 30 second version. It kind of explains why there may be <b>old</b> computer companies, and there may be <b>bold</b> computer companies, but there aren't any <b>old</b>, <b>bold</b> computer companies.

While it's not quite <em>[Gran Turismo](https://www.gran-turismo.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>, it's possible to rough out the basics of a driving game with just two things: [Sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) and [Bezier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B√©zier_curve?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). This was from a while back on the Discord channel, but there was a bunch of other stuff happening at that time. It's still cool though! Thanks to DragonRider <code>jujule</code> for this one.

## Found on the Cutting Room Floor ‚úÇÔ∏è

<div style="font-size: large; text-align: left; padding-top: 20px;"><b>Book: 3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development</b></div>

If we linked to Twitter/X anymore (we don't), we would have linked to Fletcher Dunn tweet about [his and Ian Parberry's book](https://gamemath.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) mentioned above. Fletcher said it &ldquo;is now available in its entirety for free. Vectors and matrices, representing orientation in 3D, graphics and physics basics and more. Beginner to intermediate level. Remastered to be web and mobile friendly.&rdquo; Have at it.

<div style="font-size: large; text-align: left; padding-top: 20px;"><b>Nintendo Was Founded When Jack the Ripper Was Still on the Loose</b></div>

And 35 <em>other</em> [historical facts](https://www.boredpanda.com/interesting-history-facts-events-happened-same-time/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) which will mess with your perception of time. How many did you know? How many did you find surprising?

Yep, sad but true. But don't worry, you can still do it if you <b>really</b> want to do it. However, thanks to [Ben Esposito](https://trello.com/c/Dq03FqNg/1661-nobody-told-me?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) for this timely words of wisdom.
