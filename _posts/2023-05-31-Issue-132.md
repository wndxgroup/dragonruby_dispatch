This popped up in my timeline a while back, and I had to laugh&mdash;and sob&mdash;a little. If one thing is a constant in the software industry, it‚Äôs these wild swings back and forth, or sometimes even competing strategies at opposite ends of a spectrum.

Don‚Äôt let yourself get caught up in these struggles. There is no &lsquo;one right way&rsquo; to do almost anything in software. There‚Äôs only &lsquo;a right way&rsquo; to do it today, based on what you know and what you can quickly learn ... and a constant need to check and evaluate when that right way changes.

Also, on a personal note, I just wanted to say <b>thanks</b> to all who offered condolences on the passing of my dad. They were all very much appreciated.

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

Here are this issue's selections from two of the finer RubyMotion/DRGTK chat spaces:

* </a><b>Slack</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;While it may seem like only yesterday it launched&mdash;it was actually over 22 years ago!&mdash;MacOS 10 is [no longer supported by Apple](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RS2D8/p1684790965596729?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) notes Amir Rajan. While you should probably have done it a while ago üòâ it's now officially time to update your RubyMotion projects accordingly.

* <b>Discord</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;MacOS be damned, what about you fans of the [Steam distribution service](https://store.steampowered.com/channels/608064116111966245/815289039338340414/1110808311995060244?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)? Well, good news on that front as there is [now support for that](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/815289039338340414/1110808311995060244?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com), at least in beta, for the DRGTK. 

You will find participating in either and/or both of these two forums is a real benefit.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

We've talked quite a bit about the role of complexity&mdash;or rather the desirable lack of it&mdash;when it comes to game development. Here's a  great example where the developer lets apparent simplicity draw the player in, but then slowly adds complexity to increase engagement. [Craig S. Kaplan's](https://mathstodon.xyz/@csk/110432437385448617?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) game <em>[Slide to Unlock](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/slide/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> is really clever in this regard. Give it a try but use a phone or tablet when you do.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

For those of the filmmaking persuasion, there are arguably only two pieces of software required to take your Oscar-worthy project from paper-thin premise to wide release: <em>[Final Draft](https://www.finaldraft.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> to hack together the script and <em>[Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/ca/final-cut-pro/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> to edit the raw footage. In the case of the latter, did you know there's now a [version for the iPad](https://www.apple.com/ca/final-cut-pro-for-ipad/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) which seems like a marriage made in heaven, no?

Just one little oversight, though: you can't take projects from the MacOS version of FCP down to the tablet. Fortunately, Chris Hocking has quickly stepped into that gap and with <em>[Transfer Toolbox](https://postchat.io/@latenite/110433972902357815?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. Once again, not a complicated idea but this will be wildly popular shortly&mdash;that is, if the folks who are working on its approval for the App Store don't &lsquo;accidentally&rsquo; tip-off the team working on FCP for the iPad.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On...

Clever developers continue to push the envelope of what's possible with game play randomizers: Sean Hogge reports that he has made progress on his version which [contains 65535 tiles](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/1112466636599996566?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com).
