#OPED---Our Unvarnished Opinion
-----------------------------

After we added theÂ **#DRGTK---DragonRuby Game Toolkit**Â section, it was pointed out to me that the #RMW didn't really offer much in the way of Android content. So this week we are debuting our newÂ **#Android---Nothin' But...**Â section. Hit reply and let me know what you think! ---Â [WNDXlori](https://twitter.com/wndxlori?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)

#ANDROID---Nothin' but...
-----------------------

And here it is, a section dedicated to nothing but Android content. Clearly this is long overdue and we're going to kick things off with a tweet from the fertile feed ofÂ [MadeWithReactNative](https://twitter.com/mwrnative?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com): a littleÂ [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â script toÂ [start an Android emulator](https://twitter.com/mwrnative/status/1175288586352173058?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com). When we looked at this we had our fair share of "why didn't we think of that?!" Because clearly we're not as sharp as the folks over there, that's why.

#GOTW---Gem of the Week
---------------------

ASÂ [WNDXlori](https://github.com/wndxlori?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â said when she dropped this on our desk: "Not a RubyMotion gem. So sue me." ðŸ˜† To be candid, we have been steadily dropping various tools to automate social media posts. They are getting kinda pricey and, besides, nothing seems to perform as well in the wild as a 'hand crafted' tweet or post. But we were still left with a sense that aÂ *little*Â automation would still be nice andÂ [this tool is probably all we need](https://github.com/sferik/t?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com). The price is certainly right. Thanks toÂ [Erik Berlin](https://github.com/sferik?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â for this.Â **Pro tip**: if you tweet to aÂ *lot*Â of people on the list you will get rate limited pretty fast. Here'sÂ [our experimentation in pursuit of optimum posting times](https://gist.github.com/wndxlori/7145adf43cf2060a72d2?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com).

#COMM---Community

If you're like us and have a perverse, contrarian urgeÂ *not*Â to use the uber-trendyÂ [dark mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-on-dark_color_scheme?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)---for anything!---thenÂ [Tim Johnsen](https://twitter.com/timonus?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â has an easy way to have your whole app opt out. The rest of the story isÂ [best told by Tim himself](https://twitter.com/timonus/status/1173611871561113600?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com).Â **Spoiler alert**:Â [Info.plist](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/AboutInformationPropertyListFiles.html?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com). Thanks, Tim...great tip!

#AHOTW---App Highlight of the Week
--------------------------------

We'll spare you the corny crickets or cicadas sounds...suffice to say that we were not overwhelmed by nominees for #AHOTW this week. Where some see a problem, others may see an opportunity?

#DRGTK---DragonRuby Game Toolkit
------------------------------

A nice littleÂ [DragonRuby](https://dragonruby.itch.io/?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â testimonial fromÂ [Sahil Jain](https://github.com/sahiljain11?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â along with a dandy little RPG. No, not a rocket propelled grenade, but rather...or what the heck,Â [just give it a whirl](https://github.com/sahiljain11/rpg?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com).Â **Spoiler alert**:Â [Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â Lite.

#DRSH---Dragon Riders Slack Highlights
------------------------------------

[Will Jessop](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U4VCD85N3?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â over on theÂ [Dragon Riders' Slack](https://motioneers.slack.com/?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â asked a question that we're sure is on a lot of people's minds at the moment: with "no Application Loader in the newÂ [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com), how do [we] submit binaries to the app store now?" Here'sÂ [where the conversation went](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1568904213031300?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â after that.Â **Spoiler alert**:Â [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56436345/how-to-upload-to-app-store-from-command-line-with-xcode-11/56436346?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com#56436346)Â andÂ [Fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/appstore-deployment/?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com).

#TWIL---This Week I Learned
-------------------------

One of these labour-intensive, miserable little chores is moving our stuff from one machine to another. While Mac's are pretty good with that, developer tools can still cause a lot of grief.Â [Garth Mortensen](https://twitter.com/voldemortensen?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com)Â has gotten a Homebrew transferÂ [down to two lines of code](https://twitter.com/voldemortensen/status/1175086194259943424?utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=38&utm_medium=web&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com). Brilliant...thanks Garth.

That's a Wrap!
