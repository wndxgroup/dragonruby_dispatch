## FITS &#8212; Featured in the School üéì

I recently learned, yet again, that &ldquo;nothing much happens over Christmas&rdquo; is more true than even I had imagined. This was as a result of learning how many people had <b>not</b> seen my epic YouTube series <em>[The 12 Days of Mobile App Tech Christmas](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjaSTvZn0xob463I0-43w4rI2MX8CV1Hf&utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. This is twelve ultra-short-information-dense videos on all the tech you need to successfully launch your mobile app magnum opus.

Fortunately, the quote in this issue (see below) is particularly true: mangling the sentiment of Syrus' poetic words to suit my own narrow purposes, the best time to have watched these videos was when they first dropped a while back. If you had &mdash; just think! &mdash; you'd pretty much be done by now. That said, the second best time to start is <b>[right now](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjaSTvZn0xob463I0-43w4rI2MX8CV1Hf&utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</b>!

Your greatness awaits!

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech üó£Ô∏è

It seems like Amir and the gang never take a break &mdash; certainly not for Christmas, at least. On Slack (posted on Christmas Day, no less) he let us know [RubyMotion 9.2 has been released](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1703567203525719?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). Meanwhile, over on the Discord he announced that [DRGTK 5.15 and 5.14](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/815289039338340414/1193478977734594580?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) had dropped.

Does this man and these folks ever rest?

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming üïπÔ∏è

What with the bone-chilling -30C cold snap we've had here recently, there's no mistaking we're locked in the vice-like grip of another prairie winter. If that's the case for you, too, and you're lacking inspiration for your next game and need a new hook, why not make your next project seasonal!

For example, here's what Jupiter Hadley of PocketGamer's found in this realm with her <em>[Top 15 Best Winter-Themed Mobile Games on iOS and Android](https://www.pocketgamer.com/best-games/best-winter-themed-mobile-games/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>.

Now can we rapidly move onto the <em>Top 15 Best Spring-Themed Mobile Games</em>? This winter thing is already getting pretty played.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On üî¶

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CXL7j-6IDor/"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/passoni-266x181.png" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; width: 33%;"></a>

It's been said the best gifts are handmade. If that's true we're really not sure why a  [Passoni](https://passoni.com/en?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) <em>handmade</em> titanium bike hasn't shown up yet. It's been on the Christmas list year after year after year. Can't these people take a hint?

After going straight to hell for that comment, it's important to note we were reminded of this by a recent [post to Discord](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/1193719138821099650?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). In it, <em>Luomo</em> said that they had made (by hand, presumably) a video game as a birthday present for their brother. Well it started out that way at least, but the project ran six months late which meant it came in really handy as a Christmas gift instead. 

Better late than never!

## APP &#8212; All Things Appüì±

<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/vision-pro-266x177.png" style="float: right; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 20px; width: 33%;"></a>

Assuming a critical mass of customers actually pony up the $3,499 for the Apple <em>Vision Pro</em> goggles &mdash; is the jury still out on that? &mdash; then adapting your app to visionOS could be high on your list of priorities.

Fortunately, Stuart Varrall wrote an excellent article intended to help you do just that: <em>[Adapting an App to visionOS](https://varrall.substack.com/p/adapting-an-app-to-visionos?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. It's just what the doctor ordered. Which is what you'll have to be &mdash; or a lawyer or internet millionaire or professional gambler or whatever &mdash; to afford the aforementioned goggles.

## TWIL &#8212; This Week [We] Learned ü§ì

Ask ten people their opinion of the [Medium](https://medium.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) platform and you're likely to hear ten vastly different answers. However, the one thing these folks might well agree on is the &lsquo;clean layout by default&rsquo; aesthetic Medium embraced early on. While they have made a few tortured twists and u-turns along the way, it's still a good place to make your copy look good in the shortest possible time with minimum effort.

As such, taking some guidance from Medium Engineering with respect to typography is likely a good strategy. Spoiler alert, though: the title of the article is <em>[Typography Is Impossible | The Practical Guide to Why Laying Out Type Never Quite Does What You Want](https://medium.engineering/typography-is-impossible-5872b0c7f891?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. Not exactly reassuring but at least they ought to know the best way 'round &lsquo;impossible&rsquo;.

The Cliff Notes version (which is also kind of a spoiler alert): Never change fonts mid-project unless you plan to re-assess and potentially re-design <b>every screen element</b>.
