## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

As we have mentioned a number of times in the past, there are two places you can and will want to hang out for group chat goodness related to RubyMotion and DRGTK: on the <b>Discord</b> channel recently, there was news about [DRGTK 5.7 (and 5.8) Releases](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/815289039338340414/1159817750953328752?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). Over on the <b>Slack</b> channel (AKA the Motioneers), you will find this [really long thread](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1696692751736529?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) about support for Sonoma (üëçüèª) and iOS 17 (üëéüèª).

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

<a href="http://eieio.games/nonsense/game-11-flappy-bird-finder/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/flappy-dird-525x584.gif" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; width: 33%;"></a>

We're pretty sure <em>[Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> has been implemented on just about every development platform imaginable. However, we're also pretty sure this is the first time it has been implemented on MacOS Finder. This programming triumph &mdash; [Flappy Dird](http://eieio.games/nonsense/game-11-flappy-bird-finder/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) &mdash; is from [eieio.games](https://eieio.games?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com).

We hate to think what a version implemented on [TIC-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIC-80?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com), [TOSHI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Tongue_Entertainment?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com), [Torque3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_(game_engine)?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) or [Turbulenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbulenz#Turbulenz_engine?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) might be called.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

As you likely have gathered from our previous snide comments with regard to AI, we're skeptical. Why, you ask? Let us count the ways. Actually, never mind as that's a pit of vipers üêç nobody wants to visit. 

Anywho ... via [a recent tweet](https://twitter.com/Chaskiqapp/status/1694942018969927738?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) (or whatever you call tweets these days) we did find a great way for AI to help document your projects: while this an [AI plugin](https://github.com/chaskiq/plain?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) to specifically help with Rails projects, we think it's a great example of a better way forward for AI for software development in general. It can help with some of the time consuming, difficult tasks &mdash; like becoming familiar with a large codebase, for example.

So, if we think about AI as something to help and improve our lives &mdash; instead of a stealer of code or developer replacement &mdash; what would <b>you</b> like AI to do for you? Maybe the above? Something else we haven't yet considered? Let us know!

## TWIL &#8212; This Week [We] Learned ...

<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Beverly_Hills_Hotel,_1925.jpg?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com" title="Did you know the 'Hotel California' on the cover of Eagles' 1976 album of the same name does not actually exist? The cover photo is of the Beverly Hills Hotel &mdash; recognize it? Band member Don Henley was later quoted as saying it &ldquo;was our interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles&rdquo;. Now you know."><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/beverly-hills-hotel-266x266.png" style="float: right; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 20px; width: 33%;"></a>

&ldquo;You can check-out any time you like ... but you can never leave!&rdquo; Not the <em>Hotel California</em> in this case, but rather <em>Mac Catalyst</em> as described in this recent article entitled <em>[Considering Mac Catalyst? A Word of Caution ...](https://thatvirtualboy.com/remove-macos-catalyst/?utm_campaign=iOS%2BDev%2BWeekly&utm_medium=email&utm_source=iOS%2BDev%2BWeekly%2BIssue%2B628?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> from iOS Dev Weekly.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On ...

Another thing we have harped on <b>a lot</b> in the past is the value of the university-level math and physics some of us never managed to pass. Vector math is at the very foundation of video game mechanics and we really wish we understood it better. Barring that, there is <code>[ruby_vectormath](https://github.com/xenobrain/ruby_vectormath?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</code> to which we were alerted by a [discussion on the Discord](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/1162362286795673671?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) which is also worthy of your attention &mdash; not that any of us has any to spare according to [David Pogue](https://www.cbs.com/shows/video/16e3ELODhrUrGNhK0DwzJUzb35sSvdYG/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com).

## HAHA &#8212; And They All Laughed

And we thought it was only us who couldn't figure out what all those backslashes were doing.
