## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>AI Gone Wild</b></div>

I feel like everyone is weighing in on AI these days, so what could I possibly have to say that is new?

Maybe that I'm both <b>excited</b> at the potential of AI and LLM (large language model), while simultaneously being <b>horrified</b> at the wholesale layoffs of <b>all</b> the large company's staff groups working on the ethics of AI?

I'm <b>enjoying</b> the benefits of having ChatGPT input some of my own content (a PDF called Six Vital Steps to App Success), and regurgitate it into focused, bite-sized, social media content. But I'm both <b>peeved</b> at the endless reams of fake images popping up everywhere, and <b>outraged</b> at the wholesale theft of IP from artists and photographers that OpenAI and Midjourney are indulging in to train their models that are being used to generate these fakes.

I'm <b>intrigued</b> by the ability to have boilerplate code generated for my projects, and <b>horrified</b> at the idea of people using such code without really reading or understanding it.

But most of all, I'm deeply <b>disturbed</b> that people are using ChatGPT and ilk as search engines. Because they are quite provably just making shit up on the fly, and those same people are taking these AI generated responses as gospel.

Interesting times. If you'd like to play with it in your own projects, check out [RubyAI](https://github.com/alexshapalov/rubyai) and these other related AI-related articles:

## FITS &#8212; Featured in the School

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Scarpe is the new Shoes</b></div>

<em>[Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> was a super cool little Ruby toolkit for creating GUI's. This was helpful in any number of cases, but for me, it was especially fun for teaching. Especially teaching little people how to program. But <em>Shoes</em> (<em>Shoes3?</em>) has been languishing, without any updates for years.

Enter <em>[Scarpe](https://github.com/scarpe-team/scarpe?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> (Italian  üáÆüáπ for shoes üë†) by Noah Gibbs, Nick Schwaderer and others. <em>Scarpe</em> is <em>Shoes</em> in modern Ruby and webview. I'm looking forward to seeing how far along they get, because teaching Ruby to kids is a topic near and dear to my heart! I'd love to have a <em>Scarpe</em> workshop available in the WNDX School, specifically aimed at kids.

We're cheering for you [<em>Scarpe</em> team](https://ruby.social/@nickschwaderer/110134701595900043?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)!

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

Here are this issue's selections from a couple of the busier RubyMotion/DRGTK chat spaces:

* <b>Discord</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;As we head into another political season, we're not above a little campaigning. Amir [recently reported](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/815289039338340414/1090428190016675951?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) the DRGTK was &ldquo;only 26 ratings away from passing Pico8 on itch.io&rdquo;. Actually since he said that, the number is even smaller...a mere handful of votes in the category [Top Rated Tools Tagged Game Engine](https://itch.io/tools/top-rated/tag-game-engine?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). Come on DragonRiders! We can <b>do this</b>&mdash;so [vote now](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk/rate?source=game&utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) and [vote often](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk/rate?source=game&utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com).

* <b>Slack</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;And in other news, also from Amir, [RubyMotion 8.12](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1680336030762199?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) has been released. üéâ

## APP &#8212; All Things App

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/Y4zsCSRItSruK52kGX/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47no9q7rz99jrl579x03sne0l18h279gfaxpem7w60&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; width: 50%;">You likely already know that here at DRD, we're dog people. üê∂ So you could have knocked us over with a feather when we came across <em>[Color Doggy](https://adriannier.de/colordoggy/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> from Adrian Nier. It's &ldquo;your loyal color helper&rdquo;. It's a super simple app while still scratching an itch for a lot of people&mdash;almost always a winning combination.

To that end, what super simple app could you start building today?

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On...

We have an admission to make: we use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for just about everything. Writing this newsletter, recipe notes, that screenplay we keep scratching away at&mdash;it's truly the hammer when everything else is nails. So it always catches our eye when something new shows up on the Markdown landscape, such as <em>[Versatil Markdown](https://versatilapp.com/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> which is a fully featured Markdown app for Mac. Hey, and lookee here...it's written using RubyMotion (AKA the DragonRuby <em>App</em> Toolkit!)

Also, Amir is once again sharing the [all the cool things](https://ruby.social/@amirrajan/110103723120143819?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) on social media. It's an easy way to enable you to share your cool (DRGTK) things out there to the world at large, and make sure you tag @wndxlori so she can feature it here in DRD.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

Now, without taking anything away from how clever and original the idea is, we can't help but think about <b>where</b> üöΩ the core concept of the game was squared away before it was finally rolled out.
