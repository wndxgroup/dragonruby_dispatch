## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Who Will Be the Internet's Timekeeper?</b></div>

I sometimes wonder how many software developers even realize the extent of the &lsquo;free&rsquo; labour that goes into maintaining the infrastructure that keeps our development world running.

<a href="https://sites.udel.edu/research-computing/2011/12/community-cluster-named-in-honor-of-ud-prof-emeritus-david-l-mills/"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/david-mills-400x270.png" style="float: right; padding-top: 5px; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-right: 0px; width: 50%;"></a>I was reminded of this when I ran across this recent article in <em>The New Yorker</em> (of all things!) entitled <em>[The Thorny Problem of Keeping the Internetâ€™s Time](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-thorny-problem-of-keeping-the-internets-time)</em> by Nate Hopper.  It's a delightful&mdash;and deeply disturbing&mdash;tale of the principal developer of the lowly, open-source, almost invisible Network Time Protocol. Spoiler alert: he's 84 and has severe visual impairment related to glaucoma. And yet, without the code he wrote (and still oversees to some degree), civilization as we know it kinda ends. Yikes. (img: <a href="https://sites.udel.edu/research-computing/2011/12/community-cluster-named-in-honor-of-ud-prof-emeritus-david-l-mills/">University of Delaware</a>)

If you work for yourself, consider spending some time contributing or donate some hard cash to these vital efforts. If you work for a company, lobby for them to contribute, in staff time or hard cash.

The future of civilization may well depend on it.

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Meet People at Conferences!</b></div>

If you don't have your ticket for [RubyConfMini](https://www.rubyconfmini.com) yet, now's the time to get cracking. You won't want to miss out on community member Cameron Gose's DragonRuby workshop <em><a href="https://twitter.com/RubyConfMini/status/1572317433008128001">From Start to Published, Create a Game with Ruby!</a></em>

And...check around before you go and find other community members to hang out with! One of the <b>most</b> valuable parts of conferences is all the person-to-person connections you make.

Fellow humans in the same room at the same time&mdash;this is a new and exciting trend which we really think is going to catch on!

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

Here are our selections from the Slack and Discord chat spaces respectively:

* <b>Curse of Knowledge</b> &mdash; There are those amongst us who have used [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (and similar editors) for so many years, it's sometimes hard to remember the obscure &lsquo;this is not obvious for people who have never encountered&rsquo; terms. Like [Ctags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags), for example, as could have been easily applied in [this scenario](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1662965562330269).

* <b>Latest DRGTK Release</b> &mdash; v3.23 just hit the streets, and Amir has provided some [release notes](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fchannels%2F608064116111966245%2F815289039338340414%2F1029145281490599989) on Discord for your edification.

That includes multiple languages, variations in the speed of speech and thick accents. There's a [paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf), [code](https://github.com/openai/whisper) and a [model card](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/model-card.md) available for your review.

Now, if they manage to hook it up to some open-source lip reading software, they'll <em>really</em> have something, mwa-ha-ha-ha! 

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On...

A couple of issues back we professed our love for trains &#128642; and we're happy to continue on that theme. This is an entry in the <em>Teeny Tiny Game Jam</em> from Dee Schaedler appropriately called <em>[Teeny Tiny Trains](https://deeschaedler.itch.io/teeny-tiny-trains)</em>: &ldquo;[a]void a collision between two out of control trains!&rdquo; That sounds right up our alley...er, or should we say railway tracks.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

Sometimes it's just about the code and sometimes it's about what the code <em>represents</em> and what it can teach you. This is one of these times. From [Euroku Talk 2022](https://2022.euruko.org) <em>How Music Works</em> by Thijs Cadier. Here's [the slidedeck](https://speakerdeck.com/thijsc/how-music-works-using-ruby-ebf28fce-29b4-49af-916b-a493536023e7). Or, if you're one of those who likes to skip ahead to the code, [here it is](https://github.com/thijsc/how_music_works). We're not sure any of this would work in DragonRuby, but it would be interesting to try.

Speaking of Hallowe'en &#127875; sometimes there is something to be learned by looking at somebody else's horror show and take from that precisely what <b>not</b> to do. There are five great examples in <em>[Questionable Ruby](https://jsrn.net/questionable-ruby)</em>. Hilarious and, yes, horrifying!
