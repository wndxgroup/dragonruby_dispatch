## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Not Actually Cheap</b></div>

<a href="https://hachyderm.io/@thomasfuchs/109671761673225198"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/hachyderm-400x283.png" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; width: 50%;"></a>Thomas' post reminded me  the App Store's original sales and marketing normalized the proliferation of the $0.99 price for apps. And that has been a very <b>big</b> problem for the viability of apps for independent developers.

Back in the before-internet-times indie devs advertised and sold their software in magazines and on BBS systems. Sometimes you even had to mail order a diskette copy. And it wasn't cheap. Most software was over $20. And most software was focused on a specific niche, with very specific, limited features.

Now, the App Store is a great way of distributing software worldwide, but no longer a great way to market your app, because there's literally millions of other apps competing for attention in the Store.

So you're still going to need to market your app. And that costs money. Which means that $0.99 price point becomes even more problematic. I'd encourage you&mdash;and any of your friends&mdash;to think about that $0.99 price as an introductory fire sale, to generate interest in your app, but then to price it according to the <b>value</b> it provides to the people using it. An app with a useful function or a game that provides hours of entertainment should always be worth more than $0.99.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

If in doubt&mdash;niche down! While it's easy to be lured by a huge potential market for some sort of generic functionality, think also about the benefits of something very specific for a very small market&mdash;one where you might have almost <b>no</b> competition.

Okay, maybe not the eight recipes of <em>Computer Cajun Cuisine</em>&mdash;that's a bit <em>too</em> niche&mdash;but here's a great example: <em>[Nightscout](http://www.nightscout.info?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> and <em>[Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> integration so you can see your [GitHub branch and realtime blood sugar](https://hachyderm.io/@shanselman/109524889076949803?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) in your command line prompt no matter what shell or terminal.

Sure, its only truly useful to devs with diabetes but that's a well-defined, important market not everybody thinks about every day. And sadly, it's likely a bigger market than you think.

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

Here are our selections from the two most widely used RubyMotion/DRGTK chat spaces, respectively:

* <b>Slack</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;If you're like us, you tend to think of automated testing for things <em>not</em> of the user interface. But it turns out that automated testing can apply to UIs as well. <a href="https://maestro.mobile.dev">Maestro</a> is described as &ldquo;<a href="https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RS0VA/p1674854545065979?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com">kinda slow but surprisingly functional</a>&rdquo;. The <a href="https://maestro.mobile.dev/#examples">examples</a> illustrate how it works quite well.

* <b>Discord</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Game mechanics generally strive to be as realistic as possible. But how about when they are &lsquo;super-realistic&rsquo; which is to say a bit more real than real itself. OK, you really [have to see it](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fchannels%2F608064116111966245%2F674410581326823446%2F988508115722981486), to understand what we mean, exactly.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

With all this talk of AI replacing writers (that is, people like us 😱) it's refreshing and reassuring to see that there are still tools out there which are intended to be used by humans to produce dialogue which sounds, well, human and therefore appealing to other humans. For example <em>[Crochet](https://github.com/FaultyFunctions/Crochet?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>, an interactive dialogue editor which was mentioned in a recent Discord discussion regarding [narrative story telling](https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fchannels%2F608064116111966245%2F986302978585665607%2F1023338477699465296).

## TWIL &#8212; This Week I Learned...

&lsquo;Blood is thicker than water&rsquo;, &lsquo;the customer is always right&rsquo; and &lsquo;one bad apple&rsquo; are all common sayings that we use all the time. It's likely you do, too. But as pointed out by [Eniko Fox](https://peoplemaking.games/@eniko?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) recently, in a lot of cases they mean exactly the <em>opposite</em> of what we think, when seen in their entire context. Turns out German has a phrase for it: [sinnentstellende Verkürzung](https://peoplemaking.games/@eniko/109704245387343543?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com).
