## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Dark Patterns</b></div>

<a href="https://twitter.com/KnockoutKiwi/status/1570672919294128130"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/knackered-kiwi-400x452.png" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; width: 50%;"></a>I've mentioned these before. For example, the microscopic <small><code>close</code></small> button is one of the most commonly used and abused dark patterns out there in the wild. The one thing that I am absolutely sure of, is that every single one of my readers is familiar with this pattern, and has been afflicted by it. And I'm also sure you have a few favourites of your own.

So if everyone knows it, sees it&mdash;and <b>hates</b> it&mdash;why is it still so common? Because dark patterns fall into this creepy cobweb infested crevasse where &lsquo;free&rsquo; content subsidized by advertising is joined at the hip with completely unethical practices.

I think that we need to work a little harder to figure out ways to provide value, without abusing the people we depend upon to make a living. Just a thought.

One of the significant ways that <b>you</b> can contribute back to the people who create things for you for <b>free</b> is to provide reviews and testimonials. If you have found value/enjoyment/entertainment in using DragonRuby, Amir would be super grateful for a review. Doing that on [itch.io](https://itch.io), for example, is just [one click](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk/rate?source=game) away.

And if you have learned useful things from the free (or paid) content in the [WNDX School](https://wndx.school), I would also be grateful if you could leave a comment on the course, or reply to this email and let me know what you liked.

BTW, check it out! Amir and I are both going to be speaking at [RubyConf 2022](https://rubyconf.org/program) in Houston this year. I hope to see some of you there!

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

A friend of ours who edits an online journal provided a startling statistic the other day: that the average amount of time a reader reads an article before their attention wanders is a paltry <b>one minute and 12 seconds</b>. So why would anybody write anything longer than that if nobody is going to read it? Fortunately, each of the items from the two main DRGTK/DragonRuby chat spaces take not much more than that to read in their entirety.

* <b>Bugsnag</b> &mdash; Georges Auberger wrote a very succinct, to-the-point [review of crash reporters](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1662965562330269) which touches briefly on <em>Sentry</em>, <em>RayGun</em> and <em>Crashalytics</em>. But he eventually concluded (spoiler alert) [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com) best met all his criteria including, importantly, displaying the message associated with <small><code>MethodMissing</code></small>.

* <b>We Love Trains</b> &mdash; Particularly the ones that belch steam and smoke when crossing over the [Glenfinnan Viaduct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enn8xl2A880), for example (which, indidentally, you'll find on the <em>West Highland Line</em> in Scotland not to mention a pretty famous movies series). All of which is just a setup for this [neat little discussion](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/1010413989886443550) led by Ceph, who appears to be building a really lifelike train simulation. Hopefully he also eventually gets the steam and smoke just right, too.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On...

<a href="https://twitter.com/manekinekko/status/1544038822274629643"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/non-drowsy-tetromino-400x254.png" style="float: right; padding-top: 5px; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-right: 0px; width: 50%;"></a>Hands up everybody who knows what a <em>tetromino</em> is? The wrong answer is &lsquo;the latest seasonal allergy medication&rsquo;, but then again it really does sound like that. No, it's actually the name of the playing pieces in that old chestnut &#127792; <em>[Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)</em>. If you have ever considered rolling your own version using DRGTK, you're in luck. A [recent tweet](https://twitter.com/nezirzahirovic/status/1570604703724994561) from Nezir Zahirović reminded us that Ryan C. Gordon has [a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZMwRSbC4rY) mini-series on exactly that subject.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

Not familiar with <em>[Noun-Verb](https://blog.triaster.co.uk/blog/what-is-the-noun-verb-methodology-of-process-mapping)</em> diagrams? We weren't. But turns out they are a pretty good, intuitive way of documenting processes. And if you want a great, highly relevant example, here's one which documents the gameplay loop for <em>[Dead Static Drive](https://twitter.com/deadstaticdrive/status/1562364143759286273)</em>. Even knowing nothing about the game, a few minutes of studying this diagram gave us a pretty good feel for what's what.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

SaaS? PaaS? IaaS? Are all the &lsquo;as a service&rsquo; offerings giving you a pain in the aaS? Us too, but every once in a while one comes along which defers our primal scream just a little, because the idea is actually pretty good.  How about BaaS, as in <em>backend as a service</em>. Candidly, we think that something which pulls all the backend details together makes sense. If you think so too, then check out [Appwrite 1.0](https://appwrite.io/1.0), the first stable release of the &ldquo;open-source backend-as-a-service&rdquo;.

## TWIL &#8212; This Week I Learned...

A few years ago, there was an excellent documentary on PBS called [The Origami Revolution](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/the-origami-revolution/). It was an eye-opener for what has become of the humble, 1000 year old Japanese paper folding craft. But once in a while we are reminded of its elegant complexity that can make things look simple and beautiful again. What had that impact on us, recently, was [a tweet](https://twitter.com/Rainmaker1973/status/1564130727502888962) from Massimo on the subject of [Hypercubes](https://vimeo.com/99561027) by Andreas Markus Hoenigschmid.
