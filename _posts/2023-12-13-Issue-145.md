One of the recent changes at [Teachable](https://teachable.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) &mdash; the education platform that [wndx.school](https://wndx.school?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) is on &mdash; is the ability to &lsquo;gift&rsquo; a course. While it is not yet possible to actually schedule a gift course (get cracking on that Teachable!), but if you would like to gift someone a course (they can book themselves), you can! ‚ÜñÔ∏è

For example, may we suggest <em>[Programming Fundamentals with Ruby](https://wndx.school/p/ruby-programming-fundamentals?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> for the complete programming novice? This is our absolute beginners guide to programming, using the Ruby language. Alternatively, how about <em>[RubyMotion Testing In Depth](https://wndx.school/p/rubymotion-testing-in-depth?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> for the more seasoned programmer?

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

We found this [interesting toot](https://mastodon.social/@alienmelon/111449916999883527?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) üí® about how hard it is to search for help when you are a newbie &mdash; you  don‚Äôt likely have the necessary vocabulary to even get started finding the things you need to learn. Which made us think this might make a useful documentation contribution to the [DragonRuby docs](https://www.dragonriders.community/docs-prototype-docsify/#/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). And don't forget there‚Äôs a whole [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/1086465232479727707?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) for how to make such contributions!

Have you been seeing the dreaded <code>requested deployment target SDK is not available or supported by RubyMotion at this time</code>? You're in luck: here's [what to do](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1699504179788469?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) when you encounter this using the free version of RubyMotion.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On ...

There's a lot of time and energy expended hiding complexity to make an app (appear) simple. But we all know there's a <b>ton</b> of complexity behind the scenes and there are times we want to know what all that is. So, filed under the category of <em>Things We Didn‚Äôt Know We Needed</em> is <em>[Apparency](https://www.mothersruin.com/software/Apparency/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> from Mothers Ruin Software. A simple, interesting and not-to-mention useful app which opens apps to see the smoke-belching sausage factory lurking behind that shiny, innocent-looking exterior.

Also, a while back, we believe we featured a product of [Akzidenz](https://akzidenz.itch.io?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)'s fertile imagination: <em>[This game is TOO EASY](https://akzidenz.itch.io/too-easy?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. It didn't take a degree in rocket surgery to guess there was going to be a sequel: <em>[This game is TOO HARD](https://akzidenz.itch.io/too-hard?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. We tried it and it is. But then again we're not the sharpest tools in the shed.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

Game development powerhouse [Rovio](https://www.rovio.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) &mdash; yes, the <em>Angry Birds</em> Rovio &mdash; recently launched the <em>Playbook for Inclusive Game Development and Marketing</em> as described in this recent [VentureBeat article](https://venturebeat.com/games/angry-birds-maker-rovio-unveils-guide-for-inclusive-game-design/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). This is long overdue and kudos to them for advancing this important work.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

Short notice event alert! Coming up on the 15th of this month is <em>[Hacking on Ruby Prism](https://www.hexdevs.com/events/live-hacking-on-ruby-prism/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em>. This is a great (and free) opportunity to learn more about how Ruby parsing actually works.

## TWIL &#8212; This Week [We] Learned ...

This [LinkedIn article ](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rvandervoort_wearecisco-greenfuture-inspired-activity-7137792023977201664-OL2h?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) on 3D-printed &lsquo;business cards&rsquo; based on [Near Field Communications](https://developer.android.com/develop/connectivity/nfc?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) technology (NFC) caught our attention. Briefly stated, NFC enables the sharing of small data payloads over a very short distance &mdash; four centimetres or less. 

While that's pretty cool all on its own, we're wondering if the aforementioned fertile imaginations of our readers might adapt the concept to the game/app context. What are your thoughts and, by all means, please let us know what ideas you have along these lines!

## HAHA &#8212; And They All Laughed
