Lori‚Äôs been üî• on social media lately, so without further ado you should really check out [her latest reel on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2sgj8HMpHz?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com).


## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech üó£Ô∏è

If you've been getting an odd error code (along the lines of <code>ruby[38865:7941964] unrecognized runtime type</code>) when attempting to build with iOS, thankfully there is now [a workaround](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RS0VA/p1703681948435209?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) courtesy DragonRider Eamonn Webster.

Meanwhile, over on the DRGTK Discord, Dan Healy addresses the 800 pound elephant üêò in the room with &ldquo;y'all getting paid for these contributions?&rdquo; He then goes on to talk about &ldquo;freely contribut[ing] to OSS&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;a commercial product&rdquo;. It's [an interesting discussion](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/1126325797007937648/1169162177131843594?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com), worthy of your time.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming üïπÔ∏è

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rob-sheridan.com"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/rob-sheridan-266x246.png" style="float: right; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 20px; width: 33%;"></a>

When we first spotted this our initial thought was to throw it on the #HAHA pile and call it a day. Then we thought about it for a while and it actually sounds like a pretty good idea &mdash; one you might seriously consider including in your next project.

In fact, we think there are <b>lots</b> of situations where this concept would be handy: like the wifi setup for our fancy bathroom scale, for example. We only have to do that every couple of years and it inevitably involves re-learning the entire process from scratch each time. That does seem like a waste of time, no?

Deliver the right amount of correct information and only precisely when it's needed seems to be the way to go.

## TWIL &#8212; This Week [We] Learned ü§ì

Ever heard of NeRF? No, not that ‚¨ÖÔ∏è kind of Nerf. This kind of [NeRF](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/neural-radiance-fields?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com), as in <b>Ne</b>ural <b>R</b>adiance <b>F</b>ield. Forget about the complicated name &mdash; we think you're going to be wowed by what it can do. Hint: before you know it, you'll be using NeRF to scan your Nerf.

## APP &#8212; All Things Appüì±

Ever wonder why some UIs seem to have it nicely &lsquo;together&rsquo; design-wise while others look like the colour palette and the components were loaded up in a blunderbuss and fired at the canvas from a moving car? Yep, it's all about picking colours that look good and &mdash; just as important &mdash; <b>go with each other</b>.

If, like us, you're a little challenged in this regard, this new [Tailwind CSS Color Generator](https://uicolors.app/create?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) will save your day as it will ours at some point in the future. It even streamlines turning your colour choices into code as well. Very cool.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On üî¶

If you're feeling in need of a little inspiration, a solid demo is always a good place to look, as was [also noted on the Discord](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/1200849119963525150?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) recently.

## HAHA &#8212; And They All Laughed (or Cried) üé≠

A little starved for encouragement, are we?
