## OPED ― Our Unvarnished Opinion

## GOTW ― Gem of the Week

If you're getting a little fed up with news services that seem to be slanted one way or another why not consider setting up your own? "What, my own news app?" Yep, that's exactly what we mean and here are the two essential ingredients you need:

First, the good folks at [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org) have a beautiful, simple-to-use API which aggregates over "30,000 news sources and blogs". It's free to use for developers.

Then, [Latif Atci](https://github.com/latifatcii) has provided [source](https://github.com/latifatcii/DailyNews) for a great little app which shows  how to consume all that news and present it beautifully. 

Yeah, we know, as usual not really a gem exactly. But if this doesn't get your creative juices flowing then...well, it really should and lets just leave it at that.

## COMM ― Community

We've said it before but it bears repeating: we're eternally in debt to our Community for keeping a weather eye out for interesting and helpful updates:

To wit, [Esther Hare](https://twitter.com/EEhare) who tipped us off to '[Sign in with Apple](https://twitter.com/EEhare/status/1235265534045769731)'. Geez, we didn't even know that was a thing. Guess The Big A was fed-up with having Google and Facebook grabbing all that stickiness. Just what we needed, a third option for logging in. Oh well, at least Apple _pretends_ to care about our privacy.

Along the same lines, Apple is also rolling out [Universal Purchase for Mac Apps](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03232020b). This further erodes the barriers between macOS, iOS and even watchOS/tvOS with respect to app and in-app purchases. Buy once, enjoy everywhere is Apple's theory. We _think_ that's a good idea?

## AHTW ― App Highlight This Week

![](https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/miniature-gaming-590x332.png)

Uh oh. Yet another trend we totally missed. Yep, [miniature gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_wargaming) is a thing. We are **so** not cool. But setting aside that failing on our part...

[Juhani Lehtimäki](https://medium.com/@lehtimaeki) and his colleagues have come up with an app which sets some sort of new high bar for being tightly focused on _just one thing_. Whereas [BattleScribe](https://www.battlescribe.net) is a popular choice for tabletop wargamers, Juhani et al felt it fell short in one particular area: using the BattleScribe-created lists during the game itself. So they created their own to handle just this one thing. The result is [Companion for Kill Team](https://medium.com/companion-for-kill-team/introducing-companion-for-kill-team-699ca936cfa). While we may not understand the intricacies of the app like wargamers will, we absolutely respect the notion of having an app doing one thing really, _really_ well. Cool.

And before you get on your high horse about 'how big can the market be for that?' check it out on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lehtimaeki.digitaldatacards&hl=en_CA). The Early Access edition is already reporting over 1000 installs. So there.

## DRGTK ― DragonRuby Game Toolkit

Even if you've never heard of [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) there is still a very good chance that if you're reading [DragonRuby Dispatch](https://dragonrubydispatch.com) you've encountered his ideas at some point in the past. He invented the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), the perennial final assignment favourite of CompSci 101 profs everywhere. From a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ainvvy/status/1249155836796178432
) by [Dr. V. Vinay](https://twitter.com/ainvvy), we recently learned that 82 year old  Conway recently passed away from COVID-19. We extend our condolences to his family and friends and he will be truly missed.

We're happy to quote Dr. Vinay when he says "[f]or a word to be used sparingly, Conway was a genius." We're also thankful to have been prompted to read about Conway's life and we highly recommend you do the same. It was an amazing one.

## DRSH ― Dragon Riders Slack Highlights

From the always fertile channels of the [Dragon Riders Slack team](https://motioneers.slack.com) comes word that [Brett Walker](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U07D6P1D2) is dumping [Fabric](https://get.fabric.io) and is _not_ going to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

For those who missed the beginning of this story Fabric bought [Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/?&gclid=CjwKCAjwvtX0BRAFEiwAGWJyZO78V0wOVYSEvAgTGf-FD9uV0kfNU9i-MNkvllSUTmn_5sgpoHE1bxoCiS8QAvD_BwE) which is what Brett was really using in the first place. Then Google bought Fabric and insisted on rebranding it under Swiss Army Knife wannabe Firebase. We are at a loss to understand why big companies always think that's a good idea.

In any event, Brett is looking for alternatives and kicked off [a decent thread](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1586639655105300) along these lines.

## ANDROID ― Nothin' but...

We always like a tight "five things you must do..." or "nine things you should never do..." type article and we have a good one for you: [The Seven (Actually 10) Cardinal Sins of Android Development](https://proandroiddev.com/the-seven-actually-10-cardinal-sins-of-android-development-491d2f64c8e0) from [Gabor Varadi](https://proandroiddev.com/@Zhuinden). While admittedly Java centric, this article still brings up some important anti-patterns that you should NOT be using in your RubyMotion code either.

## TWIL ― This Week I Learned

Harkening back to #GOTW for just one more minute, we found ourselves looking for a quick-n-easy way to format the JSON code which NewsAPI.org barfs out. That is, if you simply use a browser to enter calls to the API as we did. We didn't have to look too far to find a decent [JSON Formatter & Validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com). Cut-n-paste the barfed up blob into the window, click the _Process_ button and―voila!―beautifully formatted JSON code for your viewing pleasure.

NOTE: For entertainment and educational purposes only. You would never use a utility like this for anything proprietary or sensitive as we're pretty sure that a copy of whatever you pasted into the window will be retained 'somewhere out there'.

## HAHA ― And They All Laughed

Oh that we should all be as creative as [Arnab Ray](https://twitter.com/greatbong) when he found a way of solving a practical, pervasive problem and keeping his suddenly housebound daughter busy. [This is cute](https://twitter.com/greatbong/status/1249037461155504128). And brilliant.
