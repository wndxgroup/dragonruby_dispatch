#OPED ‐ Our Unvarnished Opinion
-------------------------------

It's that time of year again. The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) started on December 1. If you were wanting to spend some time solving coding problems for prizes... Now's your chance. If that's not your jam, no worries, we are also coming up on [Canada Learning Code Week](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/canada-learning-code-week-2019/). That doesn't have to be limited to Canada. If you know a teacher who needs help getting started teaching code in their classroom, all the resources are [there and available](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/canada-learning-code-week-2019/#lessons)!

#FITS ‐ Featured in the School
------------------------------

The [RubyConf](https://rubyconf.org/) videos are coming fast and furious now. The folks at [Confreaks](https://www.confreaks.com/) have put together [a great playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7tQUdRKcyZDE8nFrKaqkpd-XK4huygU) on YouTube and [WNDXLori](https://twitter.com/wndxlori)'s presentation should be out by Friday.

#DRGTK ‐ DragonRuby Game Toolkit
--------------------------------

Ever think that while the [DragonRuby Game Tookit](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk) is great, what would make it even better is some decent documentation? Think no more! You can now find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/DragonRuby/dragonruby-game-toolkit-contrib/tree/master/deploy_template/mygame/documentation).

#AHOTW ‐ App Highlight of the Week
----------------------------------

For emojis, we think [Slack](https://slack.com/) has it just about right. Y'know, type a ':', followed by the name of the emoji and---voilà!---there it is. Wouldn't it be nice if you could do that everywhere? Now you can: [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) by [Matthew Palmer](https://twitter.com/_matthewpalmer). Nope, it's not a RubyMotion app, BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN. Just sayin.

#DRSH ‐ Dragon Riders' Slack Highlights
---------------------------------------

Some highlights which are just more 'high' than others. To wit, our friend [Amir Rajan](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U07C64R8C)just announced [RubyMotion 7.0](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1575168656015400) is out, and those release notes are something else! Cue the endorphin hit. While you're there, become a  [Dragon Rider](https://motioneers.slack.com/). You'll be glad you did.

#ANDROID ‐ Nothin' but...
-------------------------

It's that time of year again. Yep, it's the NDHP (non-denominational holiday period). What to buy your loved one or, better yet, yourself for an NDHP gift? How about one of the [best new Android products](https://www.androidcentral.com/best-of-2019) as rated by [AndroidCentral](https://androidcentral.com/).

#GOTW ‐ Gem of the Week
-----------------------

[Jamon Holmgren](https://twitter.com/jamonholmgren) and [Todd Werth](https://twitter.com/twerth) have called [RedPotion](http://docs.redpotion.org/en/latest/) the Rails of RubyMotion, that is "an opinionated set of libraries and best practices". But sometimes you just need one piece of it, like [MotionPrint](https://github.com/OTGApps/motion_print).

#COMM ‐ Community
-----------------

From TAB Edit (AKA [TheAppBusiness](https://theappbusiness.com/)) on [Medium](https://edit.theappbusiness.com/), an excellent article by [Sam Dods](https://twitter.com/DodsiOS)on the newish pull-to-search idiom intended to make one-handed mobile device usage easier. All you ever wanted to know about it [is here](https://edit.theappbusiness.com/ios-pro-pull-to-search-74be33b76da).

#TWIL ‐ This Week I Learned
---------------------------

We hope we're not the last ones to know (but it *is* just possible) that in addition to [UIButton](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibutton) you can also make a tappable [UILabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilabel). [RIP Tutorial](https://riptutorial.com/) grabbed [this nugget](https://riptutorial.com/ios/example/9263/clickable-label) from archived documentation on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Dang handy.

#HAHA ‐ And They All Laughed...
-----------------------------

An innovation on the time-tested chicken 'n pig joke from [Jake Calabrese at Agile Safari](https://agileforall.com/organizational-commitment-agile-pig-chicken-part-2/).
