I hope you all had a Happy New Year ðŸŽ‰! 2019 is looking good for RubyMotion and the WNDX School.  

Sorry this is out late, but... better late than never!!!

### Featured in the School

Well, this is kind of embarrassing.  Someone had to point out that the video of a talk I gave at 
[We Are Developers World Congress](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5) 
in Vienna last May is available for streaming on YouTube now. It's called - [RubyMotion - Mobile 
& Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-9ezY8qwuc&utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5).
In this talk I introduce RubyMotion and then I built a simple Apple TV app.  Not quite 
live coding (I'm not insane).  I recorded myself live-coding it, and then played that back at 
the conf, while narrating. This will be making an appearance in the school eventually, with 
source included, but you can see it here first.  

### Slack Highlights

This [Github issue](https://github.com/amirrajan/rubymotion-applied/issues/116?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5) from Daniel Gomez Sierra originated from a discussion in Slack. There's a need 
for more beginner friendly documentation for the Android side of things, not to mention some 
better error reporting. It might not be obvious to everyone, but sometimes people come to 
RubyMotion from completely different languages, and while experienced Ruby devs can suss out the 
meaning of some of the more cryptic `rake` failures, it's not fair to those new to both Ruby & 
RubyMotion to not describe these better. I know not everyone is cut out for writing 
documentation, but if you have some experience with that, and can lend a hand, it would be much 
appreciated by all.

Back on Dec 21st, Matias Forbord ran into an issue where the [`motion` command requires internet 
access](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1545382385001400?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5).
Andrew and Amir pitched in with an explanation of why (to check if there's been a RubyMotion 
update) and how to disable it, if you are working offline.  Good to know!

And if you haven't signed up for Slack yet, you can get access by going to [motioneers.herokuapp.com](http://motioneers.herokuapp.com/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5).

### Gem of the Week

I had no idea when I acquired all of Jack's [Motion in Motion](https://motioninmotion.tv/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5) videos for the WNDX School that he 
would also pass over all of his RubyMotion specific gems!  Here's a nice little one - 
[motion-dynamic-type](https://github.com/wndxlori/motion-dynamic-type?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5). It's a very simple gem that makes using dynamic type a little more 
"friendly" in RubyMotion iOS apps. One of the reasons I like this gem, is that it serves as a 
nice little example of a [working Travis CI build](https://github.com/wndxlori/motion-dynamic-type/blob/master/.travis.yml?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5) for a RubyMotion gem. Of course, another 
thought I had was to contribute this code into BubbleWrap. What do you think?  

I'm featuring RubyMotion gems here each week.  Sometimes because they are awesome, and sometimes 
because they need some love. Remember, if you have a gem you'd like featured, just reply to this 
email, or you can PM me in Slack! 

### Community Forum

Here's something I just **love** to see.  After I highlighted [johnw's post](http://community.rubymotion.com/t/universal-links-in-ios/116?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5) on the community forum 
in [Issue #1](https://rubymotionweekly.com/2018/12/06/Issue-1.html?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5), a couple of people pitched in and helped figure out the problem. Now we all get to 
benefit from this thread on how to implement universal links.  Now, however, johnw is trying to 
get it working from [subdomains](http://community.rubymotion.com/t/universal-links-in-ios/116/13?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5). If you have any more ideas for him, hop on over and help out.

And here's your reminder to introduce yourself on the [Hello World](http://community.rubymotion.com/t/hello-world-start-here/13?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=4) post on the community forum!

### App Highlight of the Week

This week, we have [Thrillcall](https://getapp.thrillcall.com/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5) - Follow the bands you love, get concert alerts, never miss live 
music. It's both an iOS and an Android app. AND it's on Apple TV.  Super cool app, and I can't 
find the actual person to call out ðŸ˜£, but the you can find the Thrillcall website [here](https://thrillcall.com/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5).

Psst!!! If you have an app (even if it's not in the App Store) send me the details, and I'll add 
it to the list to be featured!

### TWIL (This Week I Learned) Links 

If you missed this just after Christmas, you may have problems with date display in your app.
Check out [ISO-8601, YYYY, yyyy, and why your year may be wrong](https://ericasadun.com/2018/12/25/iso-8601-yyyy-yyyy-and-why-your-year-may-be-wrong/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5) by Erica Sadun.

This one is actually pretty old, but if you've been ignoring these warnings for so long, you 
might miss it... [UIWebView is deprecated](https://twitter.com/bradeeoh/status/1009302764722184192?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=5). If you're still using that, you should switch to 
WKWebView. If you need help with that, I can probably point you to some commits on the MiM 
sample projects.  Summer students are really handy for boring fixes like that (thanks Derek!).

That's it for this week!
