## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Gone Fishin&rsquo;</b></div>

Our fearless leader Lori is taking a hard-earned and well-deserved break this issue. She will return with more of her usual pithy prose in a couple of weeks' time. Meanwhile, she has left the inmates running the asylum ...

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

Here are this issue's selections from two of the finer RubyMotion/DRGTK chat spaces:

* </a><b>Slack</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Motioneer &lsquo;Yasu&rsquo; recently posed a question as to whether the [Core Audio Data Types](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudio/core_audio_data_types?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) would eventually be available on RubyMotion. What followed is an [instructive discussion](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RS2D8/p1686143715260139?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) which included no less an authority than Amir Rajan himself.

* <b>Discord</b>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;If you have ever felt the need to &ldquo;peek right into your game state&rdquo; then you'll want to check out <em>[Palantir](https://kfischer-okarin.itch.io/palantir?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> from our friend Kevin Fischer. It's a &ldquo;live game state inspector for DragonRuby&rdquo; that requires <b>no code changes</b>. We were twigged to this by a [recent discussion on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/1019596466664243200/1116454740398714880?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com).

You will find participating in either and/or both of these two forums is a real benefit at a very affordable price&mdash;that is, <b>absolutely free</b>.

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

<a href="https://play.date?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/playdate-400x400.png" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; width: 50%;"></a>

We are pretty sure we have previously mentioned the new <em>[Playdate](https://play.date?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> handheld game system which is currently taking [pre-orders](https://shop.play.date) for &ldquo;late 2023&rdquo; delivery. Looks pretty cool&mdash;particularly the [little hand crank](https://youtu.be/HdF3CnFvxg4?t=35&utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) on the right-hand side.

In any event, they're busy &lsquo;cranking out&rsquo; games for it that they'll deliver automatically via wifi &lsquo;while you sleep&rsquo;. That said, we're not sure in a collaboration which includes companies called [Panic](https://panic.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) and [Teenage Engineering](https://teenage.engineering?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)  there will be a whole lot of sleeping going on.

In case you're wondering why we're bringing this up now, our memories were recently jogged by [this toot](https://xoxo.zone/@robotspacer/110442881983662823?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com) üí® from Mike Piontek.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

Speaking of sleepless, angst-filled nights check out <em>[Memory Spy](https://memory-spy.wizardzines.com?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com)</em> from [Julia Evans](https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/110430521225167142?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). It enables you to &ldquo;spy on a program's memory&rdquo;. Don't worry, it's nowhere near as &lsquo;1984&rsquo; as it sounds. Julia explains all in an [informative blog post](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/05/25/new-playground--memory-spy/?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). 


## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On ...

We're constantly in awe of what the DragonRuby community routinely produces. Here are just a couple of examples:

<ul>

<li>If you have ever contemplated learning Japanese and have typed <small><code>how do I learn Japanese?</code></small> into your favourite search engine, there's a pretty good chance one of the resources to which you've been pointed is <em>Flashkana</em>. It's an Android &lsquo;flashcard&rsquo; app to test your knowledge of [hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) and [katakana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana) characters. Well, now there's a [reasonable facsimile of it](https://valeureux.itch.io/flashkana) on itch.io for your edification. „Å©„ÅÜ„ÅÑ„Åü„Åó„Åæ„Åó„Å¶</li>

<li>A little less highbrow&mdash;but probably more fun!&mdash;is this cute little game called <em>A Foxy Eggventure</em>. Probably all the bait you need is the names of the two principal characters: <em>Finn</em>, the eponymous and alliterative fox and <em>Gregg</em>&mdash;as in Gregg the Egg. No relation to Cousin Greg. This was an entrant in the recently concluded [KIFASS](https://itch.io/jam/kifass)<sup>&dagger;</sup> game jam. Go ahead, we dare you to [resist giving it a try](https://dishcandanty.itch.io/a-foxy-eggventure?utm_source=new.rcsoaringdigest.com).</li>

</ul>

<sup>&dagger;</sup>Keep It Fun and Stupid, Stupid!

## TWIL &#8212; This Week I Learned ...

There seems to be no limit to what is lurking in the lowly command line. This time 'round we learned it can be used to [determine battery level](https://davidwalsh.name/get-mac-battery-level?utm_source=dragonrubydispatch.com). Kind of handy for processes that&mdash;if kiboshed by a dead battery&mdash;would willingly conspire to ruin your whole day.
