## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Should? No. Wish.</b></div>

Highly respected Agile practitioner Ron Jeffries recently wrote a new piece entitled <em><a href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/-z022/0222ff/wish/">Should? No. Wish</em></a>. I read his article a few weeks ago, and it really hit home for me. As I continue to move a little farther away from &lsquo;doing&rsquo; and dig deeper into &lsquo;teaching/mentoring&rsquo;, I have similar pondering.

Over my development career of 35 years, I have seen many different technologies come and go. I have seen many different techniques be introduced, used, abused and discarded. I have learned, and I am still learning. I teach, but I still learn when teaching others.

I have figured out what works for me, what works for my clients and what works for my students. Is any of this perfect? Far from it. Is any of this the &lsquo;one true way&rsquo; for people to develop mobile apps/games? Ha! Absolutely not. But there are some universal truths in what I teach.

So should my students be doing exactly what I teach in <em><a href="https://wndx.school/p/6-pack-apps-201904">6 Pack Apps</a></em> for example? I think their lives as app creators would be much improved if they did. But, like Ron, I don't think they <em>should</em>. I just <em>wish</em> they would.

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>App Inspiration from Unlikely Sources</b></div>

But fascinating. I wonder if the <em>CHORDMACHINE</em> could be re-created as an app?

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

The two main DragonRuby/DRGTK chat spaces are never short of time and money saving tips, tricks and traps:

* <b>An Inexpensive Entrée to Nintendo Switch</b> &mdash; On Discord, Amir recently reported that the <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-3-handheld-retro-gaming-system">Retroid Pocket 3</a> should be all you need to at least get the work started <a href="https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/815289039338340414/1018293244653744259">releasing your game to the Switch.</a>

* <b>Important Reminder Regarding Ruby Versions</b> &mdash; On Slack, Bruce Montegani asked what version of Ruby can be used with RubyMotion. The answer is (and is not) V1.9, but there's <a href="https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RS0VA/p1664165514724849">a bit more to the story</a> than that.

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On...

Did you know there is a &lsquo;fun size&rsquo; version of the <a href="https://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> called <a href="https://www.rubyconfmini.com">RubyConf Mini</a>? Us neither. It's coming up on November 15-17 in Providence, Rhode Island. What alerted us was a recent addition to the program: Cameron Gose's workshop <em><a href="https://twitter.com/RubyConfMini/status/1572317433008128001">From Start to Published, Create a Game with Ruby!</a></em> which is further described as &ldquo;ever wanted to create your own game with DragonRuby? This workshop will show you how!&rdquo;

Now, we don't want to discourage <em>anybody</em> from going to lovely Rhode Island, but in the event you're not going to be able to get there, there is just a chance you'll <b>still be able to partake in Cam's course</b>. What do we mean, exactly? Well, for that, you'll just have to keep reading DRD!

## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

Have you found yourself wondering if there was a better pattern for handling input actions using <small><code>args.inputs</code></small> directly? <a href="https://kfischer-okarin.github.io/digital-garden/notes/dr-patterns-input-actions/">There is</a> according to Kevin Fischer-Okarin.

Did you think ASCII art was ancient&mdash;y'know from, like, the 1970s or something. Well, according to Giles Booth, it turns out it's a <a href="https://twitter.com/blogmywiki/status/1570500148878544896">lot older than that<a/>.
