Here we go, six weeks in a row.  This issue is being sent to you straight from NYC. Have you 
ever eaten at [BareBurger](https://www.bareburger.com/menu/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6)?
OMNOMNOMNOM, so good.

### Featured in the School

This week I'm at a session with my business coach, planning out my year. Seems like a good time 
to ask y'all what you'd like to see in the school this year. [Here's](https://loriolson.typeform.com/to/RKK0mc?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6) 
a tiny, short form, only [3 questions](https://loriolson.typeform.com/to/RKK0mc?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6). Or, if you'd like to just hit reply, you can tell me 
exactly what you're looking for.  

### Slack Highlights

Still catching up on some stuff from my Christmas break.  John Wood asked, ["How can I use the 
REPL at runtime"](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1545423388006700?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6)?
Although this [video on the REPL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rejYKzLglSE&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6) 
is a good resource, there was a deeper problem 
here.  You see, when you start the REPL by running `rake` in your RubyMotion project, you don't 
get any prompt back now.  If you hit the enter key, then you will see the prompt.  For those 
who've been working with RubyMotion for a while, this is something we have become used to, but 
the absence of the prompt is definitely confusing for novice users.

And if you haven't signed up for Slack yet, you can get access by going to [motioneers.herokuapp.com](http://motioneers.herokuapp.com/?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6).

### Gem of the Week

Questions about authentication have come up several times in the last few weeks, so I thought it 
was about time to feature Andrew Havens' [motion-authentication](https://github.com/andrewhavens/motion-authentication?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6) 
gem. This gem makes it super easy 
to authenticate with an authentication strategy.  A [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6) strategy is included, so you can 
authenticate against a [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6) app using [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6), but you can check it out and add more strategies 
if you need a different one.

I'm featuring RubyMotion gems here each week.  Sometimes because they are awesome, and sometimes 
because they need some love. Remember, if you have a gem you'd like featured, just reply to this 
email, or you can PM me in Slack! 

### Community Forum

The forum has been pretty quiet lately, so I'm reaching back to this post from johnw on 
["Error running app on a device"](http://community.rubymotion.com/t/error-running-app-on-a-device/158?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6). When running `rake device`, this error occurred:

```bash
cannot find developer disk image in '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport' for version11.4.1
Error when starting debug server service: code -402653150
Make sure RubyMotion is using a valid (non-expired) provisioning profile
and that no other process (iTunes, Xcode) is connected to your iOS device
at the same time (even through Wi-Fi).
```

So, this helpful error message about the provisioning profile was a bit of a red herring. The 
*actual* problem was, as stated, that the DDI for iOS 11.4.1 was not installed.

And here's your reminder to introduce yourself on the [Hello World](http://community.rubymotion.com/t/hello-world-start-here/13?utm_source=rm_weekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6) post on the community forum!

### App Highlight of the Week

Did you know the awesome [Freckle](https://letsfreckle.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6) 
time tracking application (written in [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6)), has a cool 
[menubar app](https://help.letsfreckle.com/article/19-mac-os-x-app?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6) that was written with RubyMotion by the multi-talented [Thomas Fuchs](https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs?utm_source=rubymotionweekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6)? Check it out! 
Maybe you can think of a handy macOS menubar utility you'd like to write!

Psst!!! If you have an app (even if it's not in the App Store) send me the details, and I'll add 
it to the list to be featured!

### TWIL (This Week I Learned) Links 

Do you know if your app is [accessible](https://velocityraptor.co/2018/12/11/ios-accessibility-testing/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6)? 
This week I learned that it's probably [not](https://uxdesign.cc/is-your-ios-app-accessible-probably-not-heres-how-to-tell-for-sure-2950feee9165?utm_source=rubymotionweekly&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=6), but you can 
check it out yourself, and create a test plan to help you review and fix any problems.

That's it for this week!
