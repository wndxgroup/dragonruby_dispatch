I'll just channel my husband this week with his grumpy old geek hat on (he's a Linux/Unix and network systems administrator) and say that y'all shouldn't be depending on [any particular shell being available](https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1135717708673224709?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1135717708673224709&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.trello.services%2Ftweets.html%3Fver%3D40dcda94c9%26%23%257B%2522secret%2522%253A%2522EOQ0VaCs1gysYTMXe3WsYexCOurJUaUS9EDypdtYkPWZAOIo4GMROGU1uRuvaeBe%2522%252C%2522context%2522%253A%257B%2522version%2522%253A%2522build-3414%2522%252C%2522member%2522%253A%252252f0842c61ad9c986a381028%2522%252C%2522permissions%2522%253A%257B%2522board%2522%253A%2522write%2522%252C%2522organization%2522%253A%2522write%2522%252C%2522card%2522%253A%2522write%2522%257D%252C%2522organization%2522%253A%25225ae0f9707dcab637fc86bf9e%2522%252C%2522board%2522%253A%25225bfde05c6b43862de87de24a%2522%252C%2522card%2522%253A%25225cf68f0330971e786e836314%2522%252C%2522command%2522%253A%2522attachment-sections%2522%257D%252C%2522locale%2522%253A%2522en-US%2522%257D&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) on a system you are working on.

#FITS---Featured in the School
------------------------------

In case you think you missed out on last week's contest, you're in luck...we have yet to receive a correct answer! What contest you say? Well, to rehash: for **FREE** enrolment in *[RubyMotion Testing In Depth](https://wndx.school/p/rubymotion-testing-in-depth?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29)*, who infamously "*held out for the cash*" when offered payment in Apple stock by Wozniak and Jobs?

Here's an additional hint which will make this incredibly easy. The quoted can be seen speaking the quote in the 2011 documentary [Steve Jobs: One Last Thing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096615/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29). Actually, the documentary is worth watching even if it's not to help figure out the right answer.

Tweet your idea to [@WNDXschool](https://twitter.com/wndxschool?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) and if you're the first one to get it right, the free enrolment is yours! Bonus points (actually...we're kidding, there are no bonus points) if you get the unusual middle initial correct.

#DRGTK---DragonRuby Game Toolkit
------------------------------

The initial shock of how easy DRGTK makes creating 2D games may have worn off, so it makes sense to get down to the serious business of that million download game idea of yours which will enable you to live in the style to which you would like to become accustomed.

To kick that off how about *Level Design Patterns in 2D Games*. This just happens to be the title of a great [blog post](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AhmedKhalifa/20190610/344344/Level_Design_Patterns_in_2D_Games?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) on [Gamasutra](https://www.gamasutra.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) by [Ahmed Khalifa](http://akhalifa.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29), [Fernando de Mesentier Silva](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fernando_De_Mesentier_Silva?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29), and [Julian Togelius](http://julian.togelius.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29).

The crux of their post is that to "*create a game experience that is constantly engaging...it is possible to highlight common patterns that play a part in improving the quality of the design*".  In other words, there is an opportunity to leverage off the experience of others who have learned a ton from the school of hard knocks and jumpstart your own effort as a result. For those serious about game design, their blog post is must reading.

Incidentally, the post is a "*more friendly and accessible*" version of their [academic paper](http://akhalifa.com/documents/level-design-patterns.pdf?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) which provides a whole additional level of detail. Consider loading it up on your eReader and taking it with you to the beach this summer instead of that complete-waste-of-time trashy novel. All kidding aside, for real aficionados of the art & science of game design, this is a paper you will want to check out.

#MSH---Motioneers Slack Highlights
--------------------------------

Back on June 24th [Amir](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U07C64R8C?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) said "*7 days before anything that doesn't support api 26 in 64 bit, will be rejected on Google Play*". Anybody who stumbled on this one statement might be panicking right about now. **NO NEED!** In a subsequent comment, Amir corrected that to say you actually have "*7 days and **one month** before anything that doesn't support api 26 in 64 bit, will be rejected on Google Play*". That's the good news. The bad news is if you do the date arithmetic that new date is more-or-less the end of July. Better get crackin'

A further note from Amir along these same lines. In 2021 (we know, sounds like a long time, right?) Google will **delete/pull** any apps which are 32 bit only. That time is going to fly by so you still **really** need to get crackin' on this, [capisce](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Capisce&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29)?

In any event, read the whole story and/or join in [the conversation on this topic](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C056DLZ1V/p1561398799021400?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29).  What's that you say? You're not already a member of the [Motioneers](https://motioneers.slack.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29)? Seriously? You really want to put that right.

#GOTW---Gem of the Week
---------------------

[Felix Krause](https://twitter.com/KrauseFx?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29), comments "*`xcodebuild` terminal output is still mostly noise*" and laments that this is **still** the case in **2019**?! You would think they would have done something about this by now but, alas, that's not the case.

Never fear, though, because Felix also points out there are two tools which solve this problem: *[xcpretty](https://github.com/xcpretty/xcpretty?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29)* and *[trainer](https://github.com/xcpretty/trainer?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29)*. The former is used to "*convert xcodebuild plist files to JUnit reports*" and the latter is a "*flexible and fast xcodebuild formatter*".

Finally. Thanks for bringing this to our attention, Felix.

#COMM---Community
---------------

[Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) provides some insight on "*how to read an error messsage*". Before you quip "*from left to right?*"* what Julia **really** means is how do you read an error message and make sense of it and, interestingly, how to [google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_(verb)?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) it properly.

She packages all of this goodness in a [one page infographic](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1146149101995778054?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) which she tweeted out a couple of weeks back. Well worth a look.  Thanks, Julia, this is really handy, particularly for those just starting out on their code journey.

*Or, to cover all bases, "from right to left" for those who speak an [RTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) language such as Arabic, Hebrew or Persian.

#AHOTW---App Highlight of the Week
--------------------------------

We think the [crickets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwfdbTvJDaQ&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) schtick has run its course, so we're going to take a different tack here and simply point out cool apps that you **could** have made. But, sadly, now somebody else has beaten you to it.

To wit, [Lightcatch](https://www.lightcatch.net/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) out of beautiful Grande Prairie, Alberta. They/it were recently featured in a [CBC article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/lightcatch-grande-prairie-darren-boyer-alberta-crime-1.5194139?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) which describes the app as enabling "*users to alert nearby members to a crime via text, photos and video. Witnesses can provide updates that show up on a map in real time and alert other users in the area*". Why didn't you think of that, right?  Their [54 second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA4lNBcn4sg&utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29) captures the concept in a nutshell and we think it's really, **really** cool.

C'mon, folks, this is free advertising and it's perfectly OK to nominate your own app for #AHOTW! Countless millions of #RMW readers await!

#TWIL---This Week I Learned
-------------------------

I think it's fair to say the majority of #RMW readers of users of *[git](https://git-scm.com/?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29)*, right? Assuming that's correct, a reminder you can extend *git* with any old command you like. Here's a great example: *[git-conflicts](https://github.com/pengwynn/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/git-conflicts?utm_source=rubymotionweekly.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=newsletter&utm_content=29)* which lists all of the files currently in a conflict state. As the kids like to say, "awesome".

By the way, we're seriously considering adding additional *git* commands to cover off all of the spelling mistakes we make over and over and over...

That's a Wrap!
