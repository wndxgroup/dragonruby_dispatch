## OPED &#8212; Lori's Unvarnished Opinion

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Software Is Never Done Until It’s Out of Production</b></div>

As I wrapped up teaching another live edition of <em>6 Pack Apps</em> last week, I stumbled across this tweet:

<a href="https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1583989761160531968"><img src="https://dragonrubydispatch.com/assets/images/joy-kerr-400x245.png" style="float: left; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 0px; width: 50%;"></a>And I suddenly realised that a &ldquo;definition of enough&rdquo; is far more in tune with the overall theme of what I am teaching in <em>6 Pack Apps</em> than &ldquo;definition of done&rdquo;. Oh well, too late this time, but I'll have to add it as a concept during my next live session in the new year.

If you have an interest in my <em>6 Pack Apps</em> program&mdash;whether for developers or entrepreneurs&mdash;just hit reply and let me know or join the <a href="https://6packapps.io">mailing list</a>. The course for entrepreneurs is complete, and I'm also looking for beta-students for the developers edition.

## FITS &#8212; Featured in the School

<div style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;"><b>Programming Ruby 3.2 (5th Edition): The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide</b></div>

The ‘Pickaxe&rsquo; book&mdash;the original &lsquo;how to Ruby&rsquo; reference and tutorial&mdash;is being updated again. This time with a new co-author, Noel Rappin. The original edition of this book is how Lori (and many, <em>many</em> others) learned Ruby, so it's good to see it being refreshed for the latest and greatest that Ruby has to offer.

If you are just getting started programming, the WNDX School has a great offering <em><a href="https://wndx.school/p/ruby-programming-fundamentals">Programming Fundamentals with Ruby</a></em>. But if you are an experienced programmer, and just want to learn the ins and outs of the Ruby language, <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/ruby5/programming-ruby-3-2-5th-edition/">Pickaxe</a> is the way to go!

## TALK &#8212; Talk of the Tech

Here are our selections from the Discord and Slack chat spaces respectively:

* <b>Linear albegra resources?</b> &mdash; There was [some discussion](https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/608064116984250379/1035102419207602196) of this subject recently (which is really integral to game programming) on Discord but no one has a &lsquo;cheat sheet&rsquo; or some such. Perhaps you know of one? On the other hand, if you're really committed to learning the subject in some depth, it's hard to beat the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra">Khan Academy</a>.

* <b>macOS Ventura issues</b> &mdash; As is often the case, the introduction of a new macOS release throws a spanner (or perhaps a whole bag of them) into the works. The clever California name notwithstanding, that is  [also the case this time round](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RDLS0/p1666763234673489).

## TWIL &#8212; This Week I Learned...

Pop quiz: do you know <em>Murphy's Law</em>? That's easy, right? Surprisingly, if you thought it was &ldquo;whatever can go wrong, will go wrong&rdquo; (and let's face it, we all do) then you'd be <b>wrong</b>. If we couldn't make the case for the extended course on linear algebra (see above) then perhaps you want to take the extended course on [the real Murph](https://twitter.com/NomeDaBarbarian/status/1583311721594114049). 

## SPOT &#8212; Spotlight On...

Back in #115 of DRD which came out at the beginning of September, we reported that [Hal & O.A.F](https://xedindustries.itch.io/hal-and-oaf?password=OafLikesPizza) was in &lsquo;sneak peek&rsquo; mode. Well, we're pleased to pass along news from Xed Industries that [it's now playable](https://twitter.com/XedIndustries/status/1583947367262261248)!


## GAME &#8212; All Things Gaming

There's some pretty good evidence the maximum time you'll have your users' attention is somewhere between seven and ten seconds. So the <em>[20 Second Game Jam](https://twitter.com/amirrajan/status/1583833500293074948)</em> recently announced by Amir will actually be harder than it sounds at first, what with trying to maintain the players attention for twice that allotted span.

If you're looking for inspiration, you may find it here: <em>[20+ Best Idle Games for iOS and Android](https://techrt.com/best-idle-games-for-ios-and-android/)</em>.

## APP &#8212; All Things App

Speaking of short attention spans, think you might be able to get through <b>one</b> line of code? If so, then the <em><a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_ruby_oneliners/one-liner-introduction.html">Ruby One-Liners Cookbook</a></em> might be just the ticket for you.
