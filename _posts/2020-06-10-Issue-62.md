## OPED ― Our Unvarnished Opinion

Not written yet, but we'll use the FB video about pausing the launch, and talk about BLM.

## FITS ― Featured in the School

The [WNDXSchool](https:/wndx.school)'s new intern is hard at work on updates for the [DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.itch.io) tutorial. It should be out before too much longer. And as soon as he finishes that, we'll be working on a new DRGTK series. Stay tuned!

## DRSH ― Dragon Riders Slack Highlights

From time-to-time we like to remind readers about _other_ great resources available to the DragonRuby community. One of the best is the [Dragon Riders Slack](https://motioneers.slack.com) team. All manner of things both big and small are discussed. A great example is the kinda scary looking crash dump posted by [Martin Kolb](https://motioneers.slack.com/team/U2T2S5KG9) recently. He had the [resolution in just 15 minutes](https://motioneers.slack.com/archives/C055RS2D8/p1591559229059100). By the way, if you're using Python 3, you're absolutely going to care about what the fixed turned out to be.

## ANDROID ― Nothin' but...

Another great resource is [Material](https://material.io), which is Google's "adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design." No, we didn't know that, either. We also like that [Aneke Peter](https://github.com/petyr47) recently riffed in [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com) about the new _MaterialDatePicker_ and then contributed [a brief tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-use-new-material-date-picker-for-android-s7k32w0) on how to use it. Date pickers are hard, so it's nice when it all comes together like this.

## GOTW ― Gem of the Week

While the term [ray casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) may not be familiar to everyone, if you've played any first-person shooter video game from [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3Ds) onwards you've seen it and benefitted from it. It creates _just enough_ of the 3D world to convince you that _all_ of it exists and makes the experience immersive. In any event, returning from our little sojourn down memory lane, there's a great new [lo-fi ray caster for DragonRuby](https://github.com/sojastar/dr_raycaster) from [sojastar](https://github.com/sojastar). It's a work in progress but looks really impressive so far.

## COMM ― Community

One of the oldest (as in we've known him for a long time and not that he's...um...never mind) and best friends of the school is the [Agile Samurai](https://pragprog.com/titles/jtrap/) himself [Jonathan Rasmussen](https://twitter.com/jrasmusson). We've always been in awe of Jonathan's rare combination of technical and teaching skills. We were recently reminded that he has great introductory videos on iOS development. Sure, it's [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) but you can always learn something useful, right? Check out this recent effort on [Extracting Views](https://twitter.com/jrasmusson/status/1260912919832739840).

## AHTW ― App Highlight This Week

So, you know there is a great and entirely cost-free way of promoting your app, right? You're looking at it. And until you finally step forward and unveil your masterpiece for all the world to see we are forced to put this forlorn placeholder here instead of you. Greatness awaits. If you'll just let us know about _your_ app.

## DRGTK ― DragonRuby Game Toolkit

We're in utter awe of this initiative of [itch.io](https://itch.io): they have brought together the efforts of 790 creators (including our good friend [Amir Rajan](https://twitter.com/amirrajan)) in the [Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality](https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality). It's over a 1000 items (including the DRGTK!) for just $5, all proceeds going to the [NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund](https://www.naacpldf.org/) and the [Community Bail Fund](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/bail_funds_george_floyd). 

But here's the real headline. The effort has already raised nearly **$3 million** towards a goal **$5 million**. Yeah, stunning. Thanks to [James Paley](https://cogconnected.com/2020/06/itch-io-blm-charity-bundle/) of [COGconnected](https://cogconnected.com) for bringing this to our attention. It's a time-limited offer, so you best get to it. Everybody wins.

## TWIL ― This Week I Learned

Like reading log files from newest-to-oldest? In other words, in reverse chronological order? Then you need to print the file in reverse order. Seriously, that's a thing, right? If so, here's [the fairly simple Unix](https://www.folkstalk.com/2011/12/print-file-in-reverse-using-unix.html) command from [FolksTalk](https://www.folkstalk.com) to do just that.

## HAHA ― And They All Laughed

Just received a one star review? Don't despair, [it may not mean what you think it means](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/gxov08/i_also_got_an_app_review/ft4muai). We're laughing, but also crying a little on the inside.
